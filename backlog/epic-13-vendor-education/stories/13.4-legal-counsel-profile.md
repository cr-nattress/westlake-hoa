### 5. Dispute Resolution Methodology: "Trailhead to Summit"

A framework for understanding legal disputes using mountaineering metaphors:

| Path | Legal Action | Description |
|------|--------------|-------------|
| "Going Home" | Withdrawal | Strategic decision to abandon dispute due to poor merits or resource constraints |
| "Having a Pow-wow" | Mediation/Negotiation | Early dialogue to find compromise before resources depleted |
| "Taking a Short Walk" | Limited Engagement | Demand letter or preliminary contact to test opponent's resolve |
| "Embarking on an Expedition" | Litigation | Filing lawsuit - requires significant resources and stamina |

### 6. When Legal Counsel Gets Involved

**Important Note for Homeowners:**

Legal counsel typically handles:
- Escalated enforcement matters
- Collections for unpaid assessments
- Governance compliance issues
- Formal legal correspondence
- Litigation and disputes

Homeowners should be aware:
- First contact is usually through property management
- Once matters escalate to legal, communication often goes through counsel
- Legal involvement may mean formal processes are being initiated
- Costs for legal involvement are often borne by the association (and thus all owners)

### 7. Notable Cases
- *Sifton v. Stewart Title Guaranty Company* - Successfully defended national title insurance company before Colorado Court of Appeals

  return (
    <div className="container mx-auto px-4 py-8">

          <AttorneyProfiles attorneys={vendor.leadership} />
          <PracticeAreasSection areas={vendor.services} />
          <DisputeMethodologySection /> {/* Custom component */}
          <WhenLegalGetsInvolvedCallout /> {/* Important notice */}
        </div>

### Callout Component for Legal Involvement

```typescript
function WhenLegalGetsInvolvedCallout() {
  return (
    <Card className="border-blue-500/50 bg-blue-50/50 dark:bg-blue-950/20">
      <CardHeader>

      </CardHeader>
      <CardContent className="space-y-4">
        <p>
          Legal counsel handles escalated matters, collections, and formal legal
          correspondence. For most day-to-day issues, contact property management first.
        </p>
        <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground">
          Once matters are escalated to legal counsel, homeowners may be directed to
          communicate through the attorney's office rather than directly with the Board
          or management.
        </p>
