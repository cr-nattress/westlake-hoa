# Story 9.6: Transparency & Accountability Section

## User Story

**As a** homeowner concerned about HOA governance
**I want** to see documented patterns and issues with HOA communications
**So that** I understand common challenges and can advocate for improvements

## Description

Create a dedicated transparency section that documents observed communication patterns, known issues, and accountability concerns from the Knowledge Base. This is the heart of what makes this an "accountability" website - presenting factual observations in a neutral manner.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Dedicated section or page for transparency issues
- [ ] Communication patterns documented
- [ ] Observed issues listed by category
- [ ] Information presented neutrally and factually
- [ ] Clear sourcing (from documented communications)
- [ ] Disclaimer about unofficial nature prominent
- [ ] No inflammatory language - facts only
- [ ] "Observed Reality" vs "Entitled To" comparison for records
