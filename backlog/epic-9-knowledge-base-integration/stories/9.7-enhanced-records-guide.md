**I want** clear information about my CCIOA rights and what to expect
**So that** I can effectively exercise my right to inspect records

- [ ] CCIOA 10-day response requirement highlighted
- [ ] "Observed Reality" section documenting actual experiences
- [ ] Practical tips based on documented patterns

## Technical Details

### Updates to Existing Page

The `/records` page already exists. This story enhances it with Knowledge Base information.

```typescript
// Additions to src/app/records/page.tsx

// Add new sections:

// 1. What You're Entitled To
const ENTITLED_RECORDS = [
  "Meeting minutes",
  "Financial summaries and statements",
  "Annual budgets",
  "Insurance summaries and certificates",
  "Policies and procedures",
  "Records inspection per CCIOA § 38-33.3-317"
];

// 2. What's Restricted
const RESTRICTED_RECORDS = [
  {
    type: "Attorney-client privileged materials",
    reason: "Legal privilege protection"
  },
  {
    type: "Executive session contents",
    reason: "Confidential board discussions"
  },
  {
    type: "Personal owner data",
    reason: "Privacy protection"
  }
];

// 3. Observed Reality
const OBSERVED_PATTERNS = [
  "Records access is often delayed beyond the 10-day CCIOA requirement",
  "Formal written requests are frequently required even for routine documents",
  "Board approval is sometimes used as a gating mechanism for record access"
];

// 4. Tips for Success
const REQUEST_TIPS = [
  "Submit requests in writing (email creates a paper trail)",
  "Cite CCIOA § 38-33.3-317 in your request",
  "Be specific about which records you're requesting",
  "Note the date of your request for tracking the 10-day deadline",
  "Follow up in writing if no response within 10 business days"
];
```
