// OR as a section in src/app/management/page.tsx
```

### Content Sections

#### 1. Choosing the Right Contact Method

| Situation | Contact | Notes |
|-----------|---------|-------|
| General questions | clientservices@boldsolutions.net | Best for initial inquiries |
| Maintenance requests | clientservices@boldsolutions.net | Document with photos |
| Records requests | Written request to Bold | Keep copy for records |
| Escalated matters | Board President or legal counsel | After management non-response |
| Emergency | AppFolio or posted emergency contact | Check community postings |

#### 2. Communication Best Practices

```typescript
const COMMUNICATION_TIPS = [
  {
    tip: "Always communicate in writing",
    reason: "Creates documentation and accountability"
  },
  {
    tip: "Keep copies of all correspondence",
    reason: "Protects your interests if disputes arise"
  },
  {
    tip: "Be specific about your request",
    reason: "Reduces back-and-forth and clarifies expectations"
  },
  {
    tip: "Include a clear deadline for response",
    reason: "Establishes accountability for follow-up"
  },
  {
    tip: "Follow up in writing after 7 business days",
    reason: "Documents lack of response if needed"
  },
  {
    tip: "Reference specific documents when applicable",
    reason: "Shows you've done your research and strengthens your position"
  }
];
```

#### 3. Escalation Triggers

```typescript
const ESCALATION_TRIGGERS = [
  "No response after 7-10 business days",
  "Repeated non-resolution of the same issue",
  "Health or safety concerns not addressed",
  "Dispute over fees, fines, or assessments",
  "Records request denied or delayed beyond statutory limits",
  "Management claims action requires Board approval"
];
```

#### 4. Communication Pattern Warning

Based on documented patterns:
- Bulk notices via AppFolio email
- Limited responsiveness to individual follow-ups
- Escalation to legal counsel for disputes or accommodations
- Delayed or absent responses to owner emails
