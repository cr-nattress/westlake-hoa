## Technical Details

### Navigation Update

```typescript
// src/lib/constants.ts
export const NAV_ITEMS = [
  { label: "Home", href: "/" },
  { label: "Documents", href: "/documents" },
  { label: "Meetings", href: "/meetings" },
  { label: "Insurance", href: "/insurance" },
  { label: "Contacts", href: "/contacts" },  // Add this
];
```

### Mobile Styles

```tsx
// Contact cards should stack on mobile
<div className="grid gap-6 md:grid-cols-2">
  {/* Contact cards */}
</div>

// Phone/email links should have sufficient tap targets
<a
  href={`tel:${phone}`}
  className="inline-flex items-center gap-2 py-2 min-h-[44px]"
