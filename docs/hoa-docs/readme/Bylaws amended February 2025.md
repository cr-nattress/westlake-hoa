The Bylaws of the Association are hereby amended by striking in their entirety Articles I through XIII, inclusive, and by substituting the following:

## ARTICLE 1 - INTRODUCTION AND PURPOSES

### Section 1.1 Introduction

These Amended and Restated Bylaws are adopted for the regulation, management and governance of the affairs of the Association. The Association was organized as a Colorado nonprofit corporation under Colorado law to act as the Association under the Condominium Declaration for Village Center Condominiums, as may be amended (the "Declaration").

### Section 1.2 Purposes

The purposes for which the Association is formed are:

(a) to protect the value and desirability of the Village Center Condominiums community (the "Community") and the Units;

(b) to further the interests of the residents of the Community and Members of the Association;

(c) to be the owners association provided for in the Declaration;

(d) to operate and govern the Community; and

(e) to provide for the administration, maintenance, preservation and architectural review of the Units and Common Elements within the Community.

## ARTICLE 2 - DEFINITIONS

The definitions set forth in the Declaration and/or by Colorado law shall apply to all capitalized terms contained in these Bylaws, unless otherwise noted.

## ARTICLE 3 - MEMBERSHIP AND VOTING

### Section 3.1 Membership and Voting

Every person who is an Owner shall be a Member of the Association. Membership shall be appurtenant to and may not be separated from ownership of any Unit. Ownership of a Unit shall be the sole qualification for membership. Votes shall be allocated pursuant to the Declaration. Fractional and cumulative voting are prohibited.

### Section 3.2 Suspension of Voting Rights

During any period in which an Owner shall be in default in the payment of any Assessment, including interest, fines, late fees, attorney fees and costs, levied by the Association, the voting rights of the Owner shall be deemed suspended by the Board of Directors, without notice or hearing, until the Assessment has been paid. Voting rights and use rights of an Owner may also be suspended for other violations for a period not to exceed 60 days or during any period of violation, whichever is greater.

### Section 3.3 Member Voting

(a) At all meetings of Members, each Member eligible to vote may vote in person or by proxy.

(b) If only one of several Owners of a Unit is present at a meeting of the Association, the Owner present is entitled to cast the vote allocated to such Unit.

(c) If more than one of the Owners is present, the vote allocated to the Unit may be cast only in accordance with the agreement of a majority of those Owners. Majority agreement exists if any one of the Owners casts the vote allocated to the Unit without protest being made promptly to the person presiding over the meeting by another Owner of the Unit. In the event of disagreement between or among co-Owners and an attempt by two or more of them to cast such vote or votes, such vote or votes shall not be counted.

(d) The vote of a corporation, partnership, limited liability company, or other legal entity may be cast by any officer, director, trustee, partner, manager, or member of such corporation, partnership, limited liability company, or other legal entity in the absence of express notice of the designation of a specific person to the Board of Directors.

(e) The chair of the meeting may require reasonable evidence that a person voting on behalf of a corporation, partnership or business trust Owner is qualified to vote.

(f) Votes allocated to Units owned by the Association may not be cast by the Board.

### Section 3.4 Transfer of Membership

Transfers of membership shall be made on the books of the Association only upon presentation of evidence, satisfactory to the Association, of the transfer of ownership of the Unit to which the membership is appurtenant.

## ARTICLE 4 - MEETINGS OF MEMBERS

### Section 4.1 Annual Meetings

An annual meeting of the Members shall be held during each of the Association's fiscal years, at such time of the year and date as determined by the Board. The directors shall be elected by the Members at the annual meeting, in accordance with the provisions of these Bylaws. The Members may transact other business as may properly come before them at the annual meeting. Failure to hold an annual meeting shall not be considered a forfeiture or dissolution of the Association.

### Section 4.2 Budget Meetings

Meetings to consider proposed budgets shall be called in accordance with the Act. The Act's budget process to be followed is as follows:

(a) The Board of Directors of the Association is to prepare and approve a proposed budget at least annually.

(b) Within 90 days after the Board of Director's adoption of the proposed budget, or such longer time as allowed by the Act, the Board of Directors must mail or otherwise deliver, including posting the proposed budget on the association's website, a summary of the proposed budget to all Members, and set a date for a meeting to consider the proposed budget. The meeting must occur within a reasonable time after mailing or other delivery of the summary, or as allowed in the Bylaws.

(c) Notice for the meeting at which the budget will be considered must be mailed not less than 10 days nor more than 50 days before the meeting.

(d) At the meeting, unless Members holding at least a majority of the votes entitled to be cast in the Association, or any higher percentage as may be set forth in the Declaration, vote to reject the proposed budget, the proposed budget becomes the approved budget of the Association.

(e) A quorum is not required at the meeting if the meeting is just a budget meeting. If the meeting is also an annual or special meeting at which other business is to be conducted, a quorum is required for other business to be conducted at the annual or special meeting, but not for consideration of the budget.

(f) In the event the proposed budget is rejected, the budget last ratified is continued until such time as a subsequent budget proposed by the Board of Directors is ratified.

### Section 4.3 Special Meetings

Special meetings of the Association may be called by the president, by a majority of the members of the Board of Directors or by the secretary upon receipt of a petition signed by Owners holding at least 20% of the votes in the Association. The form of notice, date, time and place of the meeting shall be determined by the Board. If a notice for a special meeting demanded pursuant to petition is not given by the secretary within 30 days after the date the written demand or demands are delivered to the secretary, the person(s) signing the demand or demands may set the time and place of the meeting and give notice, pursuant to the terms of these Bylaws. Any meeting called under this Section shall be conducted by the president of the Board, or in their absence, a person chosen by a majority of the Board. In the event no Board members are in attendance, a chairperson for the meeting shall be elected by a majority of the Members present at the meeting, and that chairperson shall conduct the meeting.

### Section 4.4 Notice of Meetings

Notice of each meeting of the Members shall be physically posted in a conspicuous place if feasible and practicable at least 24 hours prior to any meeting of the Members. Written notice of each meeting of Members shall be given by, or at the direction of, the secretary or person authorized to call the meeting, by mailing a copy of the notice, postage prepaid, or by personal delivery, at least 10 days before, but not more than 50 days before the meeting to each Member, addressed to the Member's address last appearing on the books of the Association, or supplied by a Member to the Association for the purpose of notice.

In addition to mailing, but not in lieu of, notice may also be sent by any other means permitted by the Colorado Revised Nonprofit Corporation Act, including, but not limited to, e-mail delivery. If the Association has the ability to give electronic notice, the Association shall e-mail notice of the Members' meeting to any Member who requests, and who provides their e-mail address to the Association in addition to the above specified delivery of notice. Any such e-mail notice shall be given at least 24 hours prior to the meeting. The notice shall specify the place, day and hour of the meeting and, in the case of a special meeting, the purpose of the meeting. No matters shall be heard nor action adopted at a special meeting except as stated in the notice.

### Section 4.5 Place of Meetings

Meetings of the Members shall be held in the Community, in any other location in the Gunnison County area, or in any other suitable place convenient to the Members, as may be designated by the chair of the meeting.

### Section 4.7 Proxies for Members Meetings

(a) The vote allocated to a Unit may be cast under a proxy duly executed by an Owner.

(b) All proxies shall be in writing and filed with the secretary or designee of the Association.

(c) If a Unit is owned by more than one person, each Owner of the Unit may vote or register protest to the casting of the vote by the other Owners of the Unit through a duly executed proxy. In the event of disagreement between or among co-Owners and an attempt by two or more of them to cast such vote or votes, such vote or votes shall not be counted.

(d) An Owner may revoke a proxy given under this section by written notice of revocation to the person presiding over a meeting of the Association or by attending the meeting and voting in person, after giving actual notice to the person presiding over the meeting of the Owner's intent to do so.

(e) A proxy is void if it is not dated.

(f) A proxy terminates 11 months after its date, unless the proxy indicates an earlier termination date.

(g) Proxies obtained through fraud or misrepresentation are invalid as determined in the sole discretion of the Secretary of the Association.

### Section 4.8 Order of Business

The Board may establish the order of business for all meetings of the Board or Members. Failure to strictly follow Robert's Rules of Order shall not invalidate any action taken at a meeting of the Board or Members.

### Section 4.9 Waiver of Objection of Notice

A Member's attendance at a meeting waives objection to lack of notice or defective notice of the meeting, unless the Member, at the beginning of the meeting, objects to holding the meeting or transacting business at the meeting because of lack of notice or defective notice. Further, a Member's attendance at a meeting waives objection to consideration of a particular matter at the meeting that is not within the purpose or purposes described in the meeting notice, unless the Member objects to considering the matter when it is presented.

### Section 4.10 Voting Procedures/Secret Balloting

(a) Secret ballots must be used if required by law.

(b) All other voting may be by voice, by show of hands, by consent, by mail, by electronic means, by proxy, by written ballot, or as otherwise determined by the Board of Directors prior to the meeting or by a majority of the Members present at a meeting.

### Section 4.11 Voting by Mail Ballot

(a) In any instance where a vote of the Members is required or permitted to be taken at a meeting of the Members, such vote may be taken by written ballot in lieu of a meeting, pursuant to this Section. In case of a vote by written ballot in lieu of a meeting, the secretary shall mail or deliver written notice and a ballot to all Members. The notice shall include: (i) a statement of the proposed action, (ii) a statement that Members are entitled to vote for or against such proposal, (iii) a date at least 10 days after the date such notice shall have been given on or before which all ballots must be received by the Association, (iv) the number of ballots which must be received to meet the quorum requirement and the percentage of votes received needed to carry the vote; and (v) state the time by which the ballots must be received by the Association to be counted. The notice shall also be accompanied by written information sufficient to permit each person casting such ballot to reach an informed decision on the matter.

(b) The Association may conduct elections of directors by mail, in its sole discretion, and pursuant to procedures adopted by it; provided however, that any procedures adopted shall provide for notice to Members of the opportunity to run for a vacant position and/or nominate any Member of the Association for a vacant position, subject to the nominated Member's consent.

(c) A written mail ballot, once received by the Association, may not be revoked.

Members may attend meetings by using an electronic or telephonic communication method whereby the Member may be heard by the other Members and may hear the deliberations of the other Members on any matter properly brought at the meeting. The Member's vote shall be counted and the presence noted as if that Member were present in person.

### Section 4.13 Voting in Elections of Directors/Other Voting

In an election of directors, candidates receiving the largest number of votes shall be elected. On all other items, the vote of Members holding a majority of the votes cast shall be binding upon all Members for all purposes except where a higher percentage vote is required in the Governing Documents, as amended, or by law.

### Section 4.14 Acceptance or Rejection of Individual Votes

The Association has the right to reject a vote, consent, written ballot, waiver, proxy appointment or proxy appointment revocation when it has a reasonable, good faith basis to doubt the validity of the signature or the signatory's authority to sign for the Owner. The Association and its officer or agent who accepts or rejects any of the above in good faith is not liable for any damages that may result from the acceptance or rejection. Unless a court decides otherwise, any action taken on the acceptance or rejection of any of the above will be deemed valid.

### Section 4.15 Counting of Ballots

All ballots shall be counted by a neutral third party, or a committee of volunteers who are Owners and are not Board members and not candidates in a contested election, selected or appointed at an open meeting in a fair manner by the chair of the Board or person presiding at such meeting or as otherwise required by law and as may be further defined by policy or procedures of the Association.

## ARTICLE 5 - BOARD

### Section 5.1 Number

The affairs of the Association shall be governed by a Board of Directors which shall consist of five members, elected or appointed as provided below. The composition of the Board shall be based upon a ratio equal to the total square footage of Commercial Units in the community and the total number of Residential square footage in the community. Currently, approximately 60% of the community is Residential and 40% Commercial, thus the Board currently shall be comprised of three (3) Residential directors and two (2) Commercial directors.

The Residential Unit Owners shall be entitled to elect the number of the Board members equivalent to their percentage ownership in the community; and the Business Unit Owners shall be entitled elect Board members equivalent to their relative ownership in the community. The fractions shall be adjusted to the nearest 20% (one Board member for each 20% allocated to the class).

In the case where through removal or resignation, the total number of Board members is less than five, the Board will be considered properly constituted until such vacancies are filled. Appointments shall be made from the class of directors which a vacancy occurs.

### Section 5.2 Qualification

(a) Directors shall be Owners or representatives of Owners of Units in the Community.

(b) Only one Owner per Unit, eligible to vote, current in the payment of Assessments, and otherwise in good standing, may be elected to, or appointed to fill a vacancy on the Board.

(c) If any Unit is owned by a partnership, trust, corporation, limited liability company, or other legal entity, any officer, partner, director, manager, member, trustee, or employee of that entity shall be eligible to serve as a director.

(d) Any Owner who is more than 30 days delinquent in payment of any Assessment shall not be qualified to serve on the Board.

(e) Any Owner who is in violation of any provision of the Governing Documents of the Association for more than 30 days, after notice and the opportunity for a hearing, shall not be qualified to serve on the Board.

(f) An Owner who initiates an adverse legal proceeding against the Association is not qualified to serve.

(g) If, by the affirmative vote of the remaining members of the Board, a director is deemed not qualified to serve on the Board, the director's position shall be deemed vacant by resignation.

### Section 5.3 Term of Office for Directors

The term of office of directors shall be three years for directors elected by the Residential Unit Owners and two years for directors elected by the Business Unit Owners. The terms of the directors shall be staggered with the terms of one Residential director and one Commercial director's terms expiring annually.

### Section 5.4 Resignation of Directors

Any director may resign at any time by giving written notice to the president, to the secretary or to the Board of Directors stating the effective date of the resignation. Acceptance of a resignation shall not be necessary to make the resignation effective.

(a) One or more directors or the entire Board of Directors may be removed at a Special Meeting of Members called pursuant to these Bylaws, with or without cause, by a vote of a majority of all Members of the class of directors to be removed. Notice of a Special Meeting of the Members to remove directors shall set forth that the meeting is being conducted for that purpose and shall be provided to every Member of the Association, including the directors sought to be removed, as provided in these Bylaws. Directors sought to be removed shall have the right to be present at this meeting and shall be given the opportunity to speak to the Members prior to a vote to remove being taken.

(b) In the event of removal of one or more directors, a successor shall be elected by the Members of the class from which the director was removed at the meeting to serve for the unexpired term of their predecessor.

### Section 5.6 Vacancies

Vacancies on the Board caused by any reason (other than removal) may be filled by appointment by a majority vote of the remaining Board at any time after the occurrence of the vacancy, even though the directors present at that meeting may constitute less than a quorum. Each person so appointed shall be a director who shall serve for the remainder of the unexpired term.

### Section 5.7 Compensation

No director or officer shall receive compensation for any service the director or officer may render as a director or officer to the Association. However, any director or officer may be reimbursed for actual expenses incurred in the performance of Association duties, if allowed by state law.

## ARTICLE 6 - MEETINGS OF DIRECTORS

### Section 6.1 Regular Meetings

Regular meetings of the Board of Directors shall be held at such times, place and hour as may be fixed by the Board. The Board may set a schedule of regular meetings by resolution, and no further notice is necessary to constitute such scheduled regular meetings.

### Section 6.2 Special Meetings

Special meetings of the Board of Directors shall be held when called by the president of the Association, or by any two directors, after not less than two days' notice to each director.

### Section 6.3 Notice of Board Meetings

Except as provided in Section 6.1 above or below, written notice of each meeting of the Board shall be given by, or at the direction of, the secretary, by mailing a copy of the notice, postage prepaid, at least two days before the meeting, or by any other means permitted by the Colorado Revised Nonprofit Corporation Act, including, but not limited to, personal delivery, facsimile, and e-mail delivery, to each Board member, addressed to the Board member's address last appearing on the books of the Association, or supplied by a Board member to the Association for the purpose of notice. If a notice for a special meeting demanded pursuant to Section 6.2 is not given by the Board within 30 days after the date the written demand or demands are delivered to the Board, the directors signing the demand or demands may set the time and place of the meeting and give notice, pursuant to the above terms of Section 6.3 of these Bylaws. The notice shall specify the place, day and hour of the meeting, and, in the case of a special meeting, the purpose of the meeting.

### Section 6.4 Location of Meetings and Open Meetings

(a) All meetings of the Board of Directors shall be open to attendance by Members, as provided by applicable Colorado law.

(b) All meetings of the Board of Directors shall be held in the Community or in the Gunnison County or Denver metropolitan area, unless all directors consent in writing to another location.

(c) All meetings of the Board of Directors may be conducted in person, via conference call, via electronic means, or via any other method permitted by applicable Colorado law.

(d) Rules and Regulations and amendments of the Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws may not be adopted in closed or executive sessions of the Board.

(e) For any executive session or closed Board meeting, minutes kept for that part of the meeting should only indicate that an executive session was held and the general subject of the executive session.

### Section 6.5 Waiver of Notice

Any director may waive notice of any meeting in writing. Attendance by a director at any meeting of the Board shall constitute a waiver of notice. If all the directors are present at any meeting, no notice shall be required, and any business may be transacted at the meeting.

### Section 6.6 Quorum

At all meetings of the Board a majority of the directors currently in office shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business, unless there are fewer than three directors, in which case all directors must be present to constitute a quorum. The votes of a majority of the directors present at a meeting at which a quorum is present shall constitute a decision of the Board unless there are fewer than three directors, in which case, unanimity of the directors is required to constitute a decision of the Board.

### Section 6.7 Proxies for Board Meetings

For the purposes of casting a vote for or against a particular issue, a director may execute, in writing, a proxy to be held by another director. The proxy shall specify a yes or no vote on each particular issue for which the proxy was executed.

### Section 6.8 Consent to Corporate Action

The directors shall have the right to take any action, except the adopting of a rule or regulation, in the absence of a meeting, which they could otherwise have taken at a meeting, by:

(a) Obtaining the unanimous verbal vote of all directors which vote shall be noted in the minutes of the next meeting of the Board and ratified at that time; or

(b) Providing written notice to each director of a proposed action to be taken. Such notice shall include the date and time by which the directors must respond to the proposed action and shall state that failure to respond by the time stated in the notice will have the same effect as abstaining in writing to a proposed action and failing to demand in writing that action not be taken without a meeting. Upon receiving written notice of a proposed action, each director, by the date and time provided for in such notice, may: (i) vote in writing for such action; (ii) vote in writing against such action; (iii) abstain in writing from voting; (iv) fail to respond or vote; or (v) demand in writing that action not be taken without a meeting.

(1) In the event a sufficient number of affirmative votes for the proposed action are cast in writing and not revoked by the time stated in the notice that equal or exceed the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to take such action at a meeting at which all of the directors then in office were present and voted, then the action is taken unless one or more directors demands that the action not be taken without a meeting. In the event action is taken pursuant to this provision, the action shall be noted in the minutes of the next meeting of the Board and ratified at that time.

(2) Any director who in writing has voted, abstained, or demanded action not be taken without a meeting pursuant to this Section may revoke such vote, abstention, or demand in writing; provided such revocation is received by the Association by the time and date stated in the notice for such proposed action. A director's right to demand that action not be taken without a meeting shall be deemed to have been waived unless the Association receives such demand from the director in writing by the time stated in the notice for such proposed action and such demand has not been revoked.

(c) Any action taken under subsections (a) and (b)(1) above shall have the same effect as though taken at a meeting of the directors and shall be effective at the end of the time stated in the notice for such proposed action.

### Section 6.9 Telephone or Electronic Communication in Lieu of Attendance

A director may attend a meeting of the Board by using an electronic or telephonic communication method whereby the director may be heard by the other Members and may hear the deliberations of the other Members on any matter properly brought before the Board. The director's vote shall be counted and the presence noted as if that director were present in person.

### Section 6.10 Unit Owner Participation

Owners must be allowed to speak before the Board votes on any issue under discussion. The Board shall allow a reasonable number of persons to speak on each side of the issue, but the Board may place reasonable restrictions on the time allowed for each Owner to speak. Owners may also be allowed to speak at such other times as the Board, in its sole discretion, deems appropriate.

## ARTICLE 7 - POWERS AND DUTIES OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS

### Section 12.2 Determination Required

(a) The Board of Directors shall determine whether the person requesting indemnification has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth above.

(ii) by the voting members, but voting members who are also at the same time seeking indemnification may not vote on the determination.

### Section 12.3 Payment in Advance of Final Disposition

The Association shall pay for or reimburse the reasonable expenses as described above in advance of final disposition of the action, suit or proceeding if the person requesting indemnification provides the Board of Directors with:

(b) A written statement that the person shall repay the advance if it is ultimately determined that he or she did not meet the standard of conduct described above.
