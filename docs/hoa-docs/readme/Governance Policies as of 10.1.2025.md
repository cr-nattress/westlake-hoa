## POLICY OF VILLAGE CENTER CONDOMINIUM ASSOCIATION REGARDING PROCEDURES FOR COLLECTION OF UNPAID ASSESSMENTS

**SUBJECT:** Adoption of a policy and procedure regarding the collection of unpaid assessments.

**PURPOSE:** To provide notice of the Association's adoption of a uniform and systematic procedure to collect assessments and other charges of the Association.

**AUTHORITY:** The Declaration, Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Association and Colorado law.

**EFFECTIVE DATE:** October 1, 2025

**RESOLUTION:** The Association hereby gives notice of its adoption of the following policies and procedures for the collection of assessments and other charges of the Association:

### 1. Due Dates
Installments of the annual assessment and any other balances due as determined by the Association and as allowed for in the Declaration shall be due and payable on the 10th day of each month. Assessments or other charges not paid in full to the Association within one day of the due date shall be considered past due and delinquent. Assessments or other charges not paid in full to the Association within 10 days of the due date shall incur late fees and interest as provided below.

### 2. Receipt Date
The Association or its managing agent shall post payments on the day that the payment is received in the Association's office.

### 3. Late Charges and Interest on Delinquent Installments
The Association or its managing agent shall impose on a monthly basis a $10.00 late charge for each Owner who fails to timely pay any assessment within 10 days of the due date. This late charge shall be a "common expense" for each delinquent Owner. The Association or its managing agent shall impose interest from the date due at the rate of 8% per annum on the amount owed for each Owner who fails to timely pay their monthly installment of any assessment within 10 days of the due date.

### 4. Personal Obligation for Late Charges and Interest
The late charge and interest shall be the personal obligation of the Owner(s) of the Unit for which such assessment or installment is unpaid. All late charges and interest shall be due and payable immediately, without notice, in the manner provided by the Declaration (and as set forth herein) for payment of assessments.

### 5. Return Check Charges
In addition to any and all charges imposed under the Declaration, Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws, the Rules and Regulations of the Association or this Policy, a return check fee, not to exceed $20.00, shall be assessed against an Owner in the event any check or other instrument attributable to or payable for the benefit of such Owner is not honored by the bank or is returned by the bank for any reason whatsoever, including but not limited to insufficient funds. This returned check charge shall be a "common expense" for each Owner who tenders payment by check or other instrument which is not honored by the bank upon which it is drawn. Such return check charge shall be due and payable immediately, upon demand. Notwithstanding this provision, the Association shall be entitled to all additional remedies as may be provided by applicable law. Returned check charges shall be the obligation of the Owner(s) of the Unit for which payment was tendered to the Association. Returned check charges shall become effective on any instrument tendered to the Association for payment of sums due under the Declaration, Articles, Bylaws, Rules and Regulations or this Policy after the date adopted as shown above. If two or more of an Owner's checks are returned unpaid by the bank within any fiscal year, the Association may require that all of the Owner's future payments, for a period of one (1) year, be made by certified check or money order. This return check charge shall be in addition to any late fees or interest incurred by an Owner. Any returned check shall cause an account to be past due if full payment of any assessment is not timely made within 15 days of the due date.

### 6. Service Fees
In the event the Association incurs any type of service fee, regardless of what it is called, for the handling and processing of delinquent accounts on a per account basis, such fees will be the responsibility of the Owner as such fee would not be incurred but for the delinquency of the Owner. However, the cost charged to the Owner for any notice or other documentation sent to an Owner via certified mail is limited to the actual cost of the certified mail.

### 7. Repayment Plan
Any Owner who becomes delinquent in payment of assessments may enter into a repayment plan with the Association, which plan shall be for a minimum term of 18 months or such other longer term as may be approved by the Board of Directors.

Such repayment plan shall be offered to each Owner prior to the Association referring any account to an attorney or collection agency for collection action. Under the repayment plan, the Owner may choose the amount to be paid each month, so long as each payment is at least twenty-five dollars ($25.00) until the balance of the amount owed is less than twenty-five dollars ($25.00).

The Owner shall be deemed to be in default of the repayment plan and the repayment plan with the Association shall be null and void if within thirty (30) days after the Association or its managing agent has provided the Owner with a written offer to enter into a repayment plan, the Owner either declined the repayment plan; or after accepting the repayment plan, failed to pay at least three (3) of the monthly installments within fifteen (15) days after the monthly installments were due.

If the Owner does not confirm written acceptance of the repayment plan within thirty (30) days after the Association or its managing agent has provided the Owner with a written offer to enter into a repayment plan, the offer shall be deemed to be declined.

In the event the Owner defaults or otherwise does not comply with the terms and conditions of the repayment plan, including the payment of ongoing assessments of the Association, the Association may, without additional notice, refer the delinquent account to an attorney or collection agency for collection action or may take such other action as it deems appropriate in relation to the delinquency.

An Owner who has entered into a repayment plan may elect to pay the remaining balance owed under the repayment plan at any time during the duration of the repayment plan.

### 8. Attorney Fees on Delinquent Accounts
As an additional expense permitted under the Declaration and by Colorado law, the Association shall be entitled to recover its reasonable attorney fees and collection costs incurred in the collection of assessments or other charges due the Association from a delinquent Owner, within any limitations pursuant to Colorado law. The reasonable attorney fees incurred by the Association shall be due and payable immediately when incurred, upon demand.

### 9. Application of Payments
Once an account is referred to the Association's attorney, all sums collected on a delinquent account shall be remitted to the Association's attorney until the account is brought current. The Association may prohibit the Owner from accessing any online payment portal until the account is brought current. All payments received on account of any Owner or the Owner's property (hereinafter collectively "Owner"), shall be applied in the following manner: first to the payment of any assessments owed, then to any and all legal fees and costs (including attorney fees), then to expenses of enforcement and collection, late charges, returned check charges, lien fees, and other costs owing or incurred with respect to such Owner pursuant to the Declaration, Articles, Bylaws, Rules and Regulations, or this Policy.

### 10. Collection Process

#### (a) First Notice
After an installment of an annual assessment or other charges due to the Association becomes more than 30 days delinquent, the Management Company shall send a written notice ("First Notice") of non-payment, amount past due, notice that interest and late fees have accrued and request for immediate payment. This First Notice shall be a routine notice under Section 39 of the Declaration. This First Notice shall be sent by regular first class mail.

#### (b) Second Notice
After an installment of an annual assessment or other charges due to the Association becomes more than 60 days delinquent, the Management Company shall send a second written notice ("Second Notice") of non-payment, amount past due, notice that interest and late fees have accrued, notice of intent to file a lien and request for immediate payment. The Association's notice, at a minimum shall include the following:

1. The total amount due to the Association along with an accounting of how the total amount was determined.

2. Whether the Owner may enter into a payment plan and instructions for contacting the Association to arrange for and enter into a plan.

3. A name and contact information for an individual the Owner may contact to request a copy of the Owner's ledger in order to verify the amount of the debt, which copy of the ledger must be provided to the Owner no later than seven business days after receipt of the Owner's request.

4. A statement indicating that action is required to cure the delinquency and that failure to do so within thirty days may result in the Owner's delinquency account being turned over to an attorney, a collection agency, the filing of a lawsuit against the Owner, appointment of a receiver, the filing and foreclosure of a lien against the Owner's property, the sale of the Owner's unit at auction to pay delinquent assessments, which could result in the Owner losing some or all of the Owner's equity in the unit or other remedies available under Colorado Law including revoking the Owner's right to vote if permitted in the Bylaws or Declaration.

5. The availability of, and instructions on how to access, free online information through the HOA Information and Resource Center relating to the collection of assessments by an association, including the Association's ability to foreclose an association lien for unpaid assessments and force the sale of the Owner's home, and the availability of online information from the Federal Department of Housing and Urban Development concerning credit counseling before foreclosure that may be access through a link on the Department of Local Affairs' website.

6. Specify whether the delinquency concerns unpaid assessments; unpaid fines, fees or charges; or both unpaid assessments and unpaid fines, fees, or charges, and, if the notice of delinquency concerns unpaid assessments, the notice of delinquency must notify the Owner that unpaid assessments may lead to foreclosure.

7. Include a description of the steps the Association must take before the Association may take legal action against the Owner, including a description of the Association's covenant violation cure process as laid out in the Association's Covenant and Rule Enforcement Policy.

8. Include a description of what legal action the Association may take against the Owner, including a description of the types of matters that the Association or Owner may take to Small Claims Court, including injunctive matters for which the Association seeks an order requiring the Owner to comply with the Declaration, Bylaws, Covenants, or other governing documents of the Association.

#### (c) Delivery Methods for Second Notice
This Second Notice will be provided to the Owner or the Owner's designated contact in the following manners:

1. Certified mail, return receipt requested; and

2. By two of the following manners:
   - Telephone call to a telephone number that the Association has on file because the Owner or the Owner's designated contact has provided the number to the Association. If the Association attempts to contact the Owner or designated contact by telephone but is unable to contact the Owner or the Owner's designated contact, the Association shall, if possible, leave a voice message for the Owner or the Owner's designated contact; or
   - Text message to a cellular number that the Association has on file because the Owner or the Owner's designated contact has provided the cellular number to the Association; or
   - Email to an email address that the Association has on file because the Owner or the Owner's designated contact has provided the email address to the Association.
   - However, if the Owner or the Owner's designated contact has not provided a telephone number, cellular number, or email address to the Association, then this requirement of Section 10(c)(ii) shall be satisfied by sending this Second Notice via regular mail.

#### (d) Attorney Referral
After an installment of an annual assessment or other charges due to the Association becomes more than 90 days delinquent, the Management Company shall turn the account over to the Association's attorney for collection.

Any collection account referred to an attorney for collections shall first be approved by the Board of Directors via resolution or a vote of the Board recorded in the minutes of the meeting at which the vote was taken, pursuant to the Association's Conduct of Meetings Policy.

Upon receiving the delinquent account, legal counsel may file a lien and send a letter to the delinquent Owner demanding immediate payment for past due assessments or other charges due. Upon further review, legal counsel may file a lawsuit or further collection action. If a judgment or decree is obtained, including without limitation a foreclosure action, such judgment or decree shall include reasonable attorney fees together with the cost of the action and any applicable interest and late fees.

In addition to the steps outlined above, even after the Owner has been sent to the attorney for collections, on a monthly basis, the Association shall send any Owner with an outstanding balance due an itemized list of all assessments, fines, fees, and charges that the Owner owes the Association. A ledger going back to the last zero balance can satisfy this requirement.

This monthly notice shall be a routine notice under Section 39 of the Declaration. This monthly notice shall be sent by first-class mail. The monthly notice shall also be sent by email if the Association has an email address for the Owner.

This monthly notice shall be sent in English unless the Owner has indicated a preference for notices to be sent in another language.

If the Owner has identified a designated contact, this notice shall be sent to both the Owner and a copy sent to the designated contact.

This notice may not contain additional legal fees and legal costs that have been incurred by the Association but have not yet been posted to the ledger. As such, the Owner is required to communicate with the collection attorney to obtain the most up to date balance.

### 11. Collection Procedures/Time Frames
The following time frames shall be followed for use in the collection of monthly installments of the annual assessment and other charges.

| Activity | Timeframe |
|----------|-----------|
| Due Date (date payment due) | 10th day of the month due |
| Past Due Date (date payment is late if not received on or before that date) | One day after due date |
| First Notice (notice that late charges and interest have accrued) | Any time after 30 days after due date |
| Second Notice (notice that late charges and interest have accrued, notice of intent to file lien, required disclosures of the Association and the availability of a payment plan if applicable) | Any time after 60 days after due date |
| Delinquent account turned over to Association's attorney; Lien filed; Demand letter sent to Owner. | Any time after 90 days after due date |

The attorney may consult with the Association or its managing agent as necessary to determine if payment has been arranged or what collection procedures are appropriate.

### 12. Certificate of Status of Assessment
The Association or its managing agent shall furnish to an Owner or such Owner's designee upon the Owner or designee's written request to the Association, made via first class postage prepaid, return receipt requested mail, a written statement from the Association, setting forth the amount of unpaid assessments currently levied against such Owner's property at no charge and delivered personally or by certified mail, first class-postage prepaid, return receipt requested. However, if the account has been turned over to the Association's attorney, such request may be handled through the attorney. A status letter provided to a title company or mortgage company in anticipation of a sale of the property or a refinance of the mortgage provides additional information beyond a statement of the total amount due and as such any charges incurred by the Association for providing a status letter shall be charged back to the Owner.

### 13. Bankruptcies and Foreclosures
Upon receipt of any notice of a bankruptcy filing by an Owner, or upon receipt of a notice of a foreclosure by any holder of an encumbrance against any unit within the Association, Management Company shall notify the Association's attorney of the same and turn the account over to the Association's attorney, if appropriate.

### 14. Referral of Delinquent Accounts to Attorneys
Upon referral to the Association's attorney, the attorney shall take all appropriate action to collect the accounts referred. After an account has been referred to an attorney, the account shall remain with the attorney until the account is settled, has a zero balance or is written off. The attorney, in consultation with Management Company, is authorized to take whatever action is necessary and determined to be in the best interests of the Association, including, but not limited to:

(a) Filing of a suit against the delinquent Owner for a money judgment;

(b) Instituting a judicial foreclosure action of the Association's lien, upon approval by the Association's Board of Directors;

(c) Filing necessary claims, documents, and motions in bankruptcy court in order to protect the Association's interests; and

(d) Filing a court action seeking appointment of a receiver.

All payment plans involving accounts referred to an attorney for collection shall be set up and monitored through the attorney.

### 15. Appointment of a Receiver
The Association may seek the appointment of a receiver if an Owner becomes delinquent in the payment of assessments pursuant to the Declaration and Colorado law. A receiver is a disinterested person, appointed by the court, who manages the rental of the property, collects the rent and disburses the rents according to the court's order. The purpose of a receivership for the Association is to obtain payment of current assessments, reduce past due assessments and prevent the waste and deterioration of the property.

### 16. Judicial Foreclosure
The Association may choose to foreclose on its lien in addition to attempting to sue an Owner for a money judgment, subject to the provisions of Colorado law. The purpose of foreclosing is to obtain payment of all assessments owing in situations where either a money judgment lawsuit has been or is likely to be unsuccessful or other circumstances favor such action. The Association shall consider individually each recommendation for a foreclosure. Such foreclosure shall be approved by the Board of Directors via resolution or a vote of the Board recorded in the minutes of the meeting at which the vote was taken.

The Association may only approve a foreclosure action after the delinquency equals or exceeds six months of common expenses assessments based on a periodic budget adopted by the Association.

The Association may not foreclose on an Owner's Unit if the debt securing the lien consists only of one or both of the following:

(a) Fines that the Association has assessed against the Owner as a result of covenant violations; or

(b) Collection costs or attorney fees that the Association has incurred and that are only associated with assessed fines as a result of covenant violations.

If a Unit has been foreclosed on by the Association, the Unit shall not be purchased by any of the following categories of persons or companies, who are currently or have been at any time during the 5 years prior to the foreclosure sale:

(i) a member of the Board of Directors;

(ii) an employee of the Association's management company representing the Association;

(iii) an employee of the law firm representing the Association;

(iv) an immediate family member of any of the foregoing individuals; or

(v) the Association's management company.

### 17. Waivers
The Association is hereby authorized to extend the time for the filing of lawsuits and liens, or to otherwise modify the procedures contained herein, as the Association shall determine appropriate under the circumstances.

### 18. Communication with Owners
As to any communication sent by the Association or the Management company on behalf of the Association pursuant to Paragraph 10 of this Policy, the Association or management company on their behalf, shall maintain a record of any contacts, including information regarding the type of communication used to contact the Owner and the date and time that the contact was made.

An Owner may identify another person to serve as a designated contact for the Owner to be contacted on the Owner's behalf. If the Owner identifies a designated contact, the Association or its managing agent shall send any collection correspondence and notices to both the Owner and their designated contact. However, once an Owner is sent to the attorney for collections, all communication will be directly with the Owner until or unless the Owner provides permission directly to the Association's attorney giving permission for the attorney to discuss with the designated contact.

An Owner may notify the Association if the Owner prefers that correspondence and notices from the Association be made in a language other than English. If a preference is not indicated, the Association or its managing agent shall send the correspondence and notices in English. If the Owner has notified the Association of a preference other than English, any notices or letters sent pursuant to this Policy shall be sent both in English and in the preferred language.

If an Owner has identified both a designated contact and a preference for a different language, the Association or its managing agent shall send the Owner the correspondence or notice in the preferred language and in English and the designated contact the correspondence or notice in English.

All communication with a delinquent Owner shall be handled through the Association's attorney once a matter has been referred to the attorney. No member of the Board of Directors shall discuss the collection of the account directly with an Owner after it has been turned over to the Association's attorney unless the attorney is present or has consented to the contact.

### 19. Communication by Owners
Owners may communicate with the Association in any manner they choose including email, text, fax, phone, or in writing, when available. However, in doing so, the Owner acknowledges that the Association and/or its agents may communicate via the same method unless otherwise advised.

### 20. Defenses
Failure of the Association or its managing agent to comply with any provision in this Policy shall not be deemed a defense to payment of assessment fees or other charges, late charges, return check charges, attorney fees and/or costs as described and imposed by this Policy.

### 21. Definitions
Unless otherwise defined in this Policy, initially capitalized or terms defined in the Declaration shall have the same meaning herein.

### 22. Supplement to Law
The provisions of this Policy shall be in addition to and in supplement of the terms and provisions of the Declaration and the law of the State of Colorado governing the Project.

### 23. Deviations
The Board may deviate from the procedures set forth in this Policy if in its sole discretion such deviation is reasonable under the circumstances.

### 24. Amendment
This Policy may be amended from time to time by the Board of Directors.

**PRESIDENT'S CERTIFICATION:** The undersigned, being the President of Village Center Condominium Association, a Colorado nonprofit corporation, certifies the foregoing Policy was adopted by the Board of Directors of the Association by unanimous consent on July 1, 2025 and in witness thereof, the undersigned has subscribed their name.

## III. Conduct of Meetings Policy

[Note: This section appears to be cut off in the provided text - Part 1 of 2 ends here]

## Governance Policies (Continued)

1. All meetings of the Association's membership and Board of Directors shall be held in accordance with the requirements of C.R.S. §§ 38-33.3-308, 38-33.3-310, 7-127-101 through 108, 7-128-201 through 206, as the same are applicable to the Association.

2. Membership meetings shall be held at least once each year. Special meetings of the membership may be called by the President of the Association, by a majority of the Board, or by members collectively holding 20% of the votes in the Association. Notice of any meeting of the membership shall be given not less than 10 nor more than 50 days in advance of the meeting to all members by delivering or sending prepaid by U.S. mail to the mailing address of each member. The notice of any membership meeting shall be physically posted in a conspicuous place on the Association's property, if possible, in addition to mailing, and posted on the Association's website, if the Association maintains a website. Meeting notices shall state the time and place of the meeting and the items on the agenda, including the general nature of any proposed amendment to the Condominium Declaration or Bylaws, any budget changes, and any proposal to remove an officer or member of the Board.

3. Meetings of the Board, or any committee thereof, shall be open to attendance by all members of the Association or their representatives. Agendas for meetings of the Board shall be made available for examination by Association members or their representatives upon request. Notwithstanding any contrary provision contained in the Association's Bylaws, at all meetings of the Board, after a motion and second has been made on any matter to be discussed, at a time determined by the Board, but prior to the vote of the Board members, owners or their designated representatives present at such time shall be afforded an opportunity to speak on the motion. The President of the Board may place reasonable time restrictions on persons speaking during the meeting. If more than one person desires to address an issue and there are opposing views, the Board shall provide for a reasonable number of persons to speak on each side of the issue.

4. Membership meetings where there are contested elections of Board members, defined as elections in which there are more candidates than positions to fill, shall be conducted by secret ballot. Each owner entitled to vote and be present at the meeting either in person or via proxy shall receive a ballot. The ballot shall contain no identifying information concerning the ballot holder. In the event an owner holds a proxy for another owner, upon presentation of such proxy to the secretary of the Association, the owner shall receive a secret ballot to cast the vote of the owner who provided the proxy. The proxy shall be kept and retained by the Association.

5. In uncontested elections for Board positions, defined as elections in which the number of candidates is equal to or less than the positions to fill, votes taken at the meeting of the owners shall be taken in such method as determined by the Board, including but not limited to, acclamation by hand, by voice, or by ballot. Notwithstanding the foregoing, uncontested elections of Board positions or other votes on matters affecting the Association may occur by secret ballot at the discretion of the Board or upon the request of 20% of the owners who are present at the meeting or represented by proxy.

6. When secret ballots are used, written ballots shall be counted by a neutral third party, or a committee of volunteers who are not Board members, and in the case of a contested election, are not candidates. The committee shall be selected or appointed at an open meeting, in a fair manner, by the President of the Board or another person presiding during that portion of the meeting.

## IV. Policy Regarding Enforcement of Covenants and Rules and Levying of Fines

### 1. Association's Legal Duty
The Association acknowledges that it has a duty to its membership to enforce the Condominium Declaration for Village Center Condominiums, Colorado law, the Association's Rules and Regulations, Bylaws, Responsible Governance Policies and any other policies adopted by the Association, all as the same may be amended or restated from time to time. It is the policy of the Association to enforce as written any provision of the Condominium Declaration, Colorado law, the Rules and Regulations, the Bylaws, the Responsible Governance Policies, and any other policies of the Association.

### 2. Investigation of Alleged Violations
If a violation of the Association's Condominium Declaration, Colorado law, Rules and Regulations, Bylaws, Responsible Governance Policies or any other policies of the Association occurs, or a violation is alleged to have occurred by any member of the Association and such potential violation is reported to the Board of Directors, the Board shall investigate the allegations to make a determination whether such violation or threatened violation has in fact occurred. In such investigation and subsequent enforcement, if undertaken, the Board shall act in good faith and shall not act arbitrarily or capriciously.

### 3. Enforcement - Board Discretion
The enforcement of the provisions of the Condominium Declaration, Colorado law, the Rules and Regulations, the Bylaws, the Responsible Governance Policies or any other policies of the Association shall be subject to the discretion of the Board as to the timing, manner, and method of pursuing such enforcement, but in no event shall the Association's fact-finding process to determine whether a violation has occurred take longer than 60 days from the date the Association first had notice of the alleged violation. Provided that its actions are reasonable, the Board may decline enforcement of questionable violations, enforce covenants by filing suit for injunctive relief or other remedies, or levy fines for violation of rules, policies, bylaws, or covenants after notice and an opportunity to be heard is given to the alleged violator. In exercising such discretion, the Board shall consider both the specific covenant or rule violation alleged, and the overall interests of the community and Association.

### 4. Hearing Before Impartial Decision-Maker(s)
If an owner is determined to have violated the provisions of the Condominium Declaration, Colorado law, the Rules and Regulations, the Bylaws, the Responsible Governance Policies or any other policies of the Association, after notice and hearing to the alleged violator in front of an impartial decision maker, the Association may impose a fine for the violation in the amounts stated in the Association's Rules and Regulations, but in no event shall any violation incur a fine of more than $500. "Impartial decision maker" means a person or group of persons who have the authority to make decisions regarding the enforcement of the Association's Condominium Declaration, Colorado law, the Rules and Regulations, the Bylaws, the Responsible Governance Policies or any other policies of the Association and do not have any direct personal or financial interest in the outcome. A decision maker shall not be deemed to have a direct personal or financial interest in the outcome if the decision maker will not, as a result of the outcome, receive any greater benefit or detriment than will the general membership of the Association.

### 5. Owner Not Responsible for Alleged Violation
If, as a result of the fact-finding process described in this Policy, it is determined that the unit owner should not be held responsible for the alleged violation, the Association shall not allocate to the unit owner's account any of the Association's costs or attorney fees incurred in asserting or hearing the claim. Notwithstanding any provision in the Condominium Declaration, Bylaws, Rules and Regulations, or these Responsible Governance Policies to the contrary, an owner shall not be deemed to have consented to pay such costs or fees.

### 6. Violating Owner Responsible for Association Attorney Fees and Costs
It is the intent of the Board that once a violation of the provisions of the Condominium Declaration, Colorado law, the Rules and Regulations, the Bylaws, the Responsible Governance Policies or any other policies of the Association has been determined by the Board to have occurred, any expenses, costs, and legal fees incurred by the Association shall be assessed against the violating owner in the same manner as a regular assessment.

### 8. Violations that Do Not Threaten Public Safety or Health

Provide the unit owner with written notice via certified mail, return-receipt requested, in English and in any language that the unit owner has indicated a preference for correspondence and notices pursuant to Section 8 of the Association's Collection Policy above, of the violation informing the unit owner that the unit owner has thirty (30) days to cure the violation or the Association, after conducting an inspection and determining that the unit owner has not cured the violation, may fine the unit owner; however, the total amount of fines imposed for any violation may not exceed five hundred dollars ($500.00), even if said violation is continuing in nature.

c. If the unit owner cures the violation within the period to cure afforded the unit owner, the unit owner may notify the Association of the cure and, if the unit owner sends visual evidence with the notice that the violation has been cured, the violation is deemed cured on the date that the unit owner sends the notice. If the unit owner's notice does not include visual evidence that the violation has been cured, the Association shall inspect the unit as soon as practicable to determine if the violation has been cured.

d. If the Association does not receive notice from the unit owner that the violation has been cured, the Association shall inspect the unit within seven (7) days after the expiration of the thirty-day cure period to determine if the violation has been cured. If after the inspection, and whether or not the Association received notice from the unit owner that the violation was cured, the Association determines that the violation has not been cured:

   i. A second thirty-day period to cure commences if only one thirty-day period to cure has elapsed; or
   
   ii. The Association may take legal action against the unit owner if two thirty-day periods to cure have elapsed.

a. The unit owner will not be further fined with regard to the violation; and

b. The amount of any outstanding fine balance that the unit owner still owes the Association.

### 10. Continuing Violations
For violations that are continuing in nature, the Association may levy a fine or fines as stated in the Association's Rules and Regulations, but the total cap on said fines for any one continuing violation is $500.
