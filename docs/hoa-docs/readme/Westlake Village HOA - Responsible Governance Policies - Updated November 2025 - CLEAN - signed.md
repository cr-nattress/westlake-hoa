## 2. COLLECTION POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

### a. Due Dates, Late Fees, Interest, and Acceleration of Assessments

#### i. Due Dates
Regular assessments are due and payable monthly, in advance, on the first day of each month. Payment of all other assessments, special assessments, fees, fines, and other charges as allowed by Colorado law and/or the Governing Documents (with the exception of attorney fees, expenses, and costs, which are addressed below) shall be due and payable within fifteen (15) days of the Association's notice thereof. Payments shall be deemed received and may be posted on the date the payment is received in the Association's office or the Association's payment processor's office. Any installment not paid in full when due shall be considered past due and delinquent.

#### ii. Late Fees
- A $50.00 late fee will be assessed on any accounts that are one (1) month past due.
- A $150.00 late fee will be assessed on any accounts that are two (2) months past due.
- A $250.00 late fee will be assessed once per month on any accounts that are three (3) or more months past due.

Such late fees are the personal obligation of the Owner in the same manner as assessments are treated in the Governing Documents. Such late fees, if unpaid, may constitute a lien on the Unit in the same manner as assessments as set forth in the Governing Documents, CCIOA, and other Colorado law, however, these unpaid late fees cannot in and of themselves form the basis for a foreclosure action.

#### iii. Interest
Interest at the rate of 8% per annum may accrue on any delinquent regular or special assessment, fine, fee, or other charge without further notice to the Owner. Interest may be added to the Owner's account beginning fifteen (15) days following the due date. Such interest charges are the personal obligation of the Owner in the same manner as assessments are treated in the Governing Documents. Such interest charges, if unpaid, may constitute a lien on the Unit in the same manner set forth in the Governing Documents, CCIOA, and other Colorado law however, these unpaid interest charges cannot in and of themselves form the basis for a foreclosure action.

#### iv. Acceleration
When an Owner has failed to pay at least three (3) monthly installments within fifteen (15) days of each monthly installments' due date, the Board may accelerate and declare immediately due all of that Owner's unpaid installments of the annual assessment without notice. Upon acceleration, that Owner loses the privilege of paying any and all assessments and charges in installments for the remainder of the fiscal year, unless such privilege is otherwise reinstated in the Board's sole discretion. This acceleration provision is not applicable in the event that an Owner is engaged in or entitled to engage in a payment plan as otherwise set forth in this Collection Policy.

### b. Return Check Charges

#### i. Check Return Liability
If any check or other instrument payable to or for the benefit of the Association is not honored by the bank or is returned by the bank for any reason, including, but not limited to insufficient funds, the Owner is liable to the Association for one of the following amounts, at the option of the Association and in the sole discretion of the Board:

1. An amount equal to the face amount of the check, draft, or money order and a return check charge of $20.00 or an amount equal to the actual charges incurred by the Association levied by the party returning the check, whichever is greater; OR
2. If notice has been sent as provided in C.R.S. § 13-21-109 and the total amount due as set forth in the notice is not paid within 15 days after such notice is given, the person issuing the check, draft or money order may be liable to the Association for collection for three times the face amount of the check, but not less than $100.00.

#### ii. Account Impact
Any returned check may cause an account to be past due if full payment of the monthly installment of the annual assessment or of any other charge is delinquent.

#### iii. Payment Requirements
If two or more of an Owner's checks are returned unpaid by the bank within any fiscal year, the Association may require that all of the Owner's future payments, for a period of one year, be made by certified check or money order.

#### ii. Response Timeline
An Owner shall have thirty (30) days after the Association provides the Owner with a written offer to enter into a repayment plan in which to either accept or decline the repayment plan. An Owner who fails to accept the Association's written offer for a repayment plan within thirty (30) days after the written offer shall be deemed to have declined the repayment plan.

#### iii. Payment Amount
Under the repayment plan, the Owner may choose the amount to be paid each month, so long as each payment is in an amount of at least twenty-five dollars until the balance of the amount owed is less than twenty-five dollars.

#### iv. Board Discretion
More lenient repayment plans may be entered into at the sole discretion of the Board and the Board's decision to enter into a more lenient plan as to one Owner or circumstance shall not be construed as a waiver of the right of the Board to require a repayment plan that strictly complies with the minimum requirements of CCIOA.

#### v. Scope of Plan
For purposes of the repayment plan, delinquent assessments include regular and special assessments, fees, charges, late charges, attorney fees, costs, fines, interest, and any and all charges otherwise allowed by Colorado law and/or the Governing Documents.

#### vi. Eligibility Restrictions
The repayment plan delineated herein is not available to an Owner who does not occupy the unit at issue and who acquired the property (A) as a result of a default of a security interest encumbering the unit or (B) foreclosure of the Association's lien on such unit.

#### vii. Repeat Plans
The Association is not obligated to negotiate a repayment plan with an Owner who has previously entered into a repayment plan.

An Owner who has entered into a repayment plan may elect to pay the remaining balance owed under the repayment plan at any time during the duration of the repayment plan.

#### ix. Remedies for Default
The Association may pursue collection, legal action, or any other available remedies against an Owner if the Owner fails to comply with the terms of his or her repayment plan. An Owner's failure to remit payment of three or more agreed-upon installments within fifteen (15) days after each installment was due, or to remain current with regular assessments as they come due during the repayment period, constitutes a failure to comply with the terms of the Owner's repayment plan. The Association may not commence legal action to initiate a foreclosure proceeding based on an Owner's delinquency in paying assessments unless and until the Owner fails to pay at least three of the monthly installments within fifteen (15) days after the monthly installments were due.

### f. Remedies Of Association

#### i. Initial Remedies
In the event that an account remains delinquent for more than thirty (30) days after the Association's Notice of Delinquency and assuming that an Owner either is not eligible for a repayment plan, declined the repayment plan, or violated such repayment plan, the Association may, in the sole discretion of the Board, take the following action: (1) record a Notice of Assessment Lien against the subject unit and (2) refer the matter to a collection agency or attorney for further collections activities (provided that the referral has been authorized by a majority vote of the Board of Directors in a recorded vote at a meeting conducted pursuant to CCIOA § 38-33.3-308(4)(e)), which collection agency or attorney shall send a demand letter to the Owner.

#### ii. Lien Rights
In the event that the annual assessment is payable in installments, each installment may be subject to a statutory lien if the Owner fails to pay the installment within fifteen (15) days after the installment becomes due, but the Association may not pursue legal action for unpaid monthly installments until the Owner has failed to pay at least three (3) monthly installments within the time period that each monthly installment is due.

The Owner or the Owner's designated representative shall provide notice of the motion to stay the sale to the Association and to the officer. The Owner shall state in the motion to stay: (i) the fair market value of the Unit, as determined by: (a) an appraisal of the Unit; (b) a market analysis conducted by a licensed real estate agent; (c) an estimate from an online real estate marketplace company; or (d) the assessed value of the Unit recorded in the County Assessor's property tax records on the date of the Court's order to sell the Unit; (ii) an alternate value for the unit that, if less than the fair market value of the unit, exceeds the sum of all liens and any fees or costs advanced by the holder of the evidence of debt. The Court may allow the Owner additional time to submit the fair market value or alternate value to the court. The Owner shall list the Unit at the sale price specified in the motion to stay, unless the Association objects to the Owner's declared fair market value or alternate value of the Unit. The Association may submit evidence of the Unit's value to the court. Based on the evidence, the court shall set the initial list price of the Unit and may further order a change to the list price if supported by sufficient evidence. The Court's order staying the sale of the Unit at auction is in effect for nine months after the date of the order. The court may extend the stay of the sale of the Unit at auction beyond nine months upon evidence that the sale of the Unit is imminent or for good cause, as determined by the Court. If a sale date was scheduled, the officer shall post or provide notice of the continuance of the sale while the stay is in effect. The Court shall enter any orders necessary to ensure that the proceeds of the sale of the Unit are held in escrow and distributed by the Court in accordance with lien priority and other applicable law. A purchaser of a Unit listed for sale shall take title to the Unit free and clear of any encumbrances relating to filing of the foreclosure action.

3. **Continued Accrual**: Continue to accrue regular and special assessments and other fees, interest, fines, and charges against the delinquent Owners' unit until, in the Board's sole discretion, it makes economic or other sense to pursue collections activities against the Owner.

4. **Receiver Appointment**: The Board may seek the appointment of a receiver if an Owner becomes delinquent in the payment of assessments. A receiver is a disinterested person, appointed by the court, who manages the rental of the property, collects the rent and disburses the rents according to the court's order. The purpose of a receivership for the Association is to obtain payment of current assessments, reduce past due assessments, and prevent the waste and deterioration of the property.

5. **Garnishment**: At any time after obtaining a money judgment against an Owner, the Association, through its attorney, may file Writs of Garnishment with the appropriate court to attach wages or assets for the benefit of the Association in payment of the judgment.

6. **Common Element Restrictions**: The Board may revoke the delinquent Owner's right to utilize the common elements of the Association during the pendency of such Owner's delinquency.

7. **Voting Suspension**: The Board may suspend the delinquent Owner's voting privileges in the Association during the pendency of such Owner's delinquency.

8. **Other Remedies**: Any other remedies customarily and reasonably employed by the Association or homeowners' associations of its type.

### g. Small Claims Court

The Association and each Owner may utilize the processes of the Small Claims Court in actions involving injunctive relief to (1) enforce rights or responsibilities arising under the Association's Governing Documents, including actions seeking declaratory relief, subject to the jurisdictional limit of the Small Claims Court; (2) enforce restrictive covenants on residential property, subject to the jurisdictional limit of the Small Claims Court.

### h. Attorney Fees and Other Costs Of Collection

Once a matter has been referred to a collection agency or attorney for collections activities or legal action, the Association shall incur attorney fees, costs, and other expenses in connection therewith. The Association shall be entitled to recover its reasonable attorney fees and collection costs incurred in the collection of assessments or other charges due the Association from a delinquent Owner pursuant to the terms of the Governing Documents and Colorado law. The Association's right to recover reasonable attorney fees and collection costs may be limited by current Colorado law. Attorney fees, expenses, and other costs of collection incurred by the Association shall be considered part of the assessments and shall be due and payable immediately when incurred, upon demand. The Association need not initiate legal action in order to demand and recover the attorney fees, expenses, and other costs of collection incurred by the Association in addressing an Owner's delinquency.

### i. Delegation of Authority to Sign Notice of Lien

The Board delegates authority to the Association's attorney, its manager or managing agent (collectively, "Manager"), or its accountant to sign and acknowledge the Notice of Assessment Lien. This limited delegation does not delegate the Board's sole ability to authorize the referral of the matter to an attorney or collection agency or to engage in legal action as otherwise set forth in this Collection Policy and CCIOA.

### j. Communication with Association

Once a delinquent account has been referred to a collection agency or attorney as set forth in this Collection Policy, the delinquent Owner shall communicate exclusively with such collection agency or attorney unless and until the Association, either directly or by and through an attorney or agent, notifies the Owner that the Owner may discuss the delinquent account directly with the Association or the Manager

If an Owner fails to indicate a desire to speak, such Owner may be allowed to speak as the chair determines in the chair's sole discretion.

If an election or vote is to be held, the Owner will be given the appropriate number of ballots, including for any proxy that he or she might hold. Any Owner as allowed by C.R.S § 7-127-203 may give proxies. The Association's Secretary or designee shall review all proxies as to the following: 
1. Validity of the signature
2. Signatory's authority to sign for the Owner
3. Authority of the Owner to vote
4. Conflicting proxies
5. Expiration of the proxy

The Association shall retain any and all proxies.

#### iii. Voting
**Contested elections of Board members** (defined as elections in which there are more candidates than positions to be filled) shall be conducted by secret ballot, unless a majority of the Owners agrees to conduct voting by hand or by voice. Each Owner entitled to vote pursuant to the Bylaws shall receive a ballot. The ballot shall contain no identifying information concerning the ballot holder.

**Uncontested elections of Board members** (defined as elections in which the number of candidates is equal to or less than the positions to be filled) and all other votes taken at a meeting of the Owners shall be taken in such method as determined by the Board including acclamation by hand, by voice, or by ballot. Notwithstanding the above, uncontested elections of Board members or other votes on matters affecting the community (whether or not binding on the Association as addressed below) shall be by secret ballot at the discretion of the Board or upon the request of 20% of the Owners who are present at the meeting or represented by proxy. If secret balloting is not required, the Association may indicate the number of proxies held on the ballot itself.

Ballots shall be counted by a neutral third party or by a committee of volunteers who may be Owners selected or appointed at an open meeting by the President of the Board or other person presiding during that portion of the meeting. The committee of volunteers may not be Board members and, in case of a contested election for a Board position, may not be candidates. The results of a vote taken by secret ballot shall be reported without identifying information of Owners participating in such vote.

Once a vote is taken, there will be no more discussion of that topic.

#### iv. Call to Order and Conduct of the Meeting
The President of the Board, or other person directed by the Board, will call the meeting to order and conduct the meeting. The meeting may proceed in the order set forth in the agenda or as set forth in the Bylaws.

#### v. Owner Participation
Each Owner who wishes to speak will be given a reasonable time to speak, provided the chair may impose reasonable time limits to facilitate Owner participation. The time limit set by the chair shall be uniform as to all Owners. Owners shall speak in the order in which they have signed in, as above. Owners may not speak a second time until everyone who wishes to speak has been given an opportunity to speak once. Owners may not speak more than twice on any one topic, subject to the chair's sole discretion. Yielding of time by a speaker to another individual shall not be permitted.

#### vi. Decorum
Owners must maintain decorum and refrain from addressing the meeting or Board until recognized by the chair. Upon being recognized, the Owner must state his/her name and address.

#### vii. Interruptions and Owner Conduct during Owner Meetings
Owners may not interrupt anyone who validly has the floor, or otherwise disrupt the meeting. Only one Owner may speak at a time. Owners may not engage in personal attacks on either Board members or other Owners. All comments and questions are to be delivered in a businesslike manner and comments may be confined to matters germane to the agenda item being discussed. No Owner may use abusive, rude, threatening, vulgar, or crude language.

#### viii. Rulings of the Chair
Owners must obey all orders made by the meeting chair, including an order to step down. Any Owner who refuses to follow the above rules will be asked to immediately leave the meeting.

#### ix. Motions of Owners
Any motions must be seconded prior to discussion and voting. Because the nature of a motion and vote may be outside the Owners' authority, the Board reserves the right to determine whether a motion will be considered binding on the Association or if there is another recommendation for proceeding or not proceeding. Such determination may be made following consultation with legal counsel.

#### x. Robert's Rules of Order
Meetings of Owners are not required to be held in accordance with Robert's Rules of Order. Robert's Rules of Order, in a simplified form, may be utilized at Owner meetings. The chair of the meeting shall set such additional rules of order as may be necessary or appropriate.

#### xi. Recording/Minutes
No meeting of the Owners may be audio, video or otherwise recorded except by the Board to aid in the preparation of minutes. The Association shall keep minutes of actions taken.

### d. Board Meetings

#### i. Notice
Notice of Board meetings shall be given to directors as provided in the Bylaws. If a schedule is set for regular Board meetings, no notice beyond the schedule need be given.

#### ii. Attendance and Executive Sessions
All Board meetings shall be open to attendance by Owners, or their representatives, provided that the Board may go into executive or closed session for the following purposes:

**(A)** Matters pertaining to employees of the Association or the Manager's contract or involving the employment, promotion, discipline, or dismissal of an officer, agent, or employee of the Association;

**(B)** Consultation with legal counsel concerning disputes that are the subject of pending or imminent court proceedings or matters that are privileged or confidential between attorney and client;

**(C)** Investigative proceedings concerning possible or actual criminal misconduct;

**(D)** Matters subject to specific constitutional, statutory, or judicially imposed requirements protecting particular proceedings or matters from public disclosure;

**(E)** Any matter the disclosure of which would constitute an unwarranted invasion of individual privacy, including a disciplinary hearing regarding an Owner and any referral of delinquency; except that an Owner who is the subject of a disciplinary hearing or a referral of delinquency may request and receive the results of any vote taken at the relevant meeting;

**(F)** Review of or discussion relating to any written or oral communication from legal counsel.

Owners may be excluded from executive or closed session. The Board may restrict attendance to Board members and such other persons requested by the Board during a regular or specially announced meeting or a part thereof. Prior to going into executive or closed session, the chair of the meeting may announce the purpose for the executive or closed session. No rule or regulation of the Board or any committee thereof shall be adopted during an executive session. A rule or regulation may be validly adopted only during a regular or special meeting after the Board goes back into regular session following an executive session. The minutes of all meetings at which an executive session was held shall indicate only that an executive session was held and the general subject matter of the executive session. Decisions made and actual discussions held at the executive session do not need to be reflected in the minutes.

#### iii. Agendas
The meeting agenda shall be made reasonably available for examination by Owners or their designated representatives. Items may be discussed pursuant to the meeting agenda, provided that items may be taken out of order if deemed advisable by the chair of the meeting. Items not on the agenda may be discussed once all other items have been concluded, time permitting. If items that are not on the agenda are discussed, Owners shall be given a reasonable opportunity to comment in accordance with the terms of these Policies and Procedures.

#### iv. Owners' Forum
There may be an Owners' forum at the beginning of each regular Board meeting. The Owners' forum shall be for up to ten minutes, or such longer time as the Board may establish, and the Board may extend this time in its sole discretion. The rules for Owner participation during the meetings are as follows:

1. Each Owner who wishes to address the Board on an agenda item or on any other matter will be given a reasonable time to speak during the Owners' Forum, provided the chair may impose reasonable time limits to facilitate Owner participation. Any time limits will be uniform as to all Owners who wish to speak. If more than one person desires to address an issue on which the Board is to vote (after a motion and a second) and there are opposing views, the Board may provide for a reasonable number of Owners to speak on each side of the issue. After other Owners have had an opportunity to speak, then an Owner who has already spoken will be given another opportunity, time permitting in the sole discretion of the chair of the meeting. Owners may not speak more than twice on any one topic, subject to the chair's discretion. Yielding of time by a speaker to another individual shall not be permitted.

2. Each Owner who wishes to speak must be recognized by the chair. Once recognized, the Owner must state his/her name and address.

3. All comments must be delivered in a businesslike and professional manner. Personal attacks or inflammatory comments will not be permitted. Comments are to be relevant to the purpose of the meeting or issue at hand.

4. An Owner who wishes to speak about any matter on the agenda of the Board meeting may do so only during the Owners' forum. An Owner who wishes to speak about any matter not on the agenda of the Board meeting may do so outside the time for the Owners' forum only if permitted by the chair as determined in the sole discretion of the chair.

5. The Board is not obligated to take immediate action on any item presented by an Owner or to immediately answer a question presented by an Owner.

6. Owners must obey all orders made by the meeting chair, including an order to step down. Any Owner who refuses to follow the rules will be asked to immediately leave the meeting.

#### v. Business of the Board
Following the conclusion of the Owners' forum, the Board will proceed with the business portion of the meeting. Owners who attend or remain may not participate in deliberation or discussion during this portion of the Board meeting unless expressly authorized by a vote of the majority of a quorum of the Board.

#### vi. Recording/Minutes
No meeting of the Board may be audio, video or otherwise recorded except by the Board to aid in the preparation of minutes. The Association shall keep minutes of actions taken.

#### vii. Robert's Rules of Order
Board meetings are not required to be held in accordance with Robert's Rules of Order.

#### viii. Action Taken Without A Meeting
The Board shall have the right to take any action in the absence of a meeting which they could take at a meeting by obtaining the written approval of all members of the Board, which writing may take the form of e-mail. Any action so approved shall have the same effect as though taken at a meeting of the Board.

### e. Deviation
The Board may deviate from the procedures set forth herein if in its sole discretion such deviation is reasonable under the circumstances.

### f. Cordial And Courteous Conduct
The requirements for businesslike and professional conduct during the course of meetings also apply to any and all communications or actions whatsoever by and/or between Owners, Board members, Association management, any person affiliated with or acting on behalf of the Association, residents, tenants, guests, licensees, invitees, occupants, persons present on Association property, and persons discussing Association business. Specifically, all such persons may not engage in personal attacks, must deliver questions or comments in a professional and businesslike manner, and must refrain from using abusive, rude, threatening, vulgar, or crude language.

## 5. COVENANT AND RULE ENFORCEMENT AND DISPUTE RESOLUTION POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

### a. Enforcement Procedure
The Board may not impose fines unless and until the Association has sent or delivered written notice to the Owner as provided below and after all other prerequisites for fines are satisfied. However, compliance with the notice and hearing procedure set forth below is not required for the following: regular or special or other assessments, late charges, interest, fees, attorney fees, costs, expenses, or other charges imposed in connection with delinquent regular or special or other assessments; self-help remedies as provided in the Declaration and this Policy; and legal action for matters not otherwise discussed in this Policy.

#### i. Complaint(s)
Any Owner within the community may send, via either e-mail or regular mail, the Association a formal, written complaint of a violation of the Governing Documents, with as much information as is known. Complaints may also be initiated by the Manager or any member of the Board. Complaints that cannot be independently verified by a Board member or the Manager must be in writing. The Board has no obligation to consider oral complaints or anonymous complaints. The Board shall have the authority and sole discretion to determine whether a written complaint is justified before continuing with the Notice and Hearing Procedure.

#### ii. Notice of Alleged Violation
A Notice of Alleged Violation of any provisions of the Governing Documents shall be provided in writing to the applicable Owner as soon as reasonably practicable following the receipt of a complaint or discovery by the Board of such violation. The Board may also, at its option, provide a copy of such Notice to any non-Owner violator. The Notice shall describe the nature of the alleged violation and the possible fine that may be imposed, the right to request a hearing before the Board to contest the alleged violation or possible fine, the steps that must be taken to cure the alleged violation, and shall further state that the Board may seek to protect its rights as they are specified in the Governing Documents. All Notices shall be delivered by certified mail, return receipt requested, and also sent by either first-class mail, text message, or e-mail to the contact information that has been provided by the Owner. All Notices must be in English or in any language for which the Owner has indicated a preference for correspondence and notices and shall also be sent to the designated contact for the Owner, if any.

#### iii. Request for Hearing
If an Owner desires a hearing to challenge or contest any alleged violation and possible fine, or to discuss any mitigating circumstances, the Owner must request such hearing, in writing, within five (5) business days of the date of the Notice of Alleged Violation. The request for hearing shall describe the grounds and basis for challenging the alleged violation or the mitigating circumstances. In the event a proper and timely request for a hearing is not made as provided in these Policies and Procedures, the right to a hearing shall be deemed forever waived. If a hearing is not requested within the five business day period, the Board may determine if there was a violation based upon the information available to it, and if so, shall continue with the Cure Process and Fine Procedure provisions set forth below.

#### iv. Board of Directors to Conduct Hearing
The Board shall hear and decide matters set for hearing pursuant to the procedures set forth in these Policies and Procedures. The Board may appoint an officer or other Owner to act as the Presiding Officer at any of the hearings and may appoint any other Owner to serve as part of the "impartial fact finder" or "impartial decision maker" body as defined in applicable Colorado law. After giving the applicable Owner reasonable opportunity to be heard on the matter at hand, the Board shall determine whether a violation exists and impose fines as appropriate.

#### v. Conflicts
Any Board member or Owner who is incapable of objective, impartial, and disinterested consideration of any matter coming to hearing before the Association shall disclose such to the President of the Association prior to the hearing on the matter, if possible, or, if advance notice is not possible, then such disclosure may be made at the hearing, and the Board member must be disqualified from all proceedings with regard to the hearing. If disqualification of any Board member(s) or Owners results in an even number of remaining Board members or Owners eligible to hear a case, the Presiding Officer may appoint an Association member, in good standing, to serve as a voting member of the hearing board.

#### vi. Hearing
The Board shall inform the Owner of the scheduled time, place, and date of the requested hearing by mail, e-mail, personal delivery, or other means. The Presiding Officer may grant continuances for good cause. At the beginning of each hearing, the Presiding Officer shall establish a quorum, explain the rules, procedures and guidelines by which the hearing will be conducted, and may introduce the case before the Board. The complaining parties and the Owner shall have the right, but not the obligation, to be in attendance at the hearing. Each party may present evidence, testimony, and witnesses. The decision of the Board at each hearing may be based on the matters set forth in the Notice of Alleged Violation and Hearing, Request for Hearing, and such evidence as may be presented at the hearing. Unless otherwise determined by the Board in accordance with the terms of CCIOA, all hearings may be open to attendance by all members of the Association. If a complaining party is unable to attend the Hearing, he or she may instead submit a letter to the Board explaining the basis of the complaint.

#### vii. Decision
After all testimony and other evidence has been presented to the Board at a hearing, the Board shall render its written findings and decision and shall thereafter follow the Cure Process and Fine Procedure provisions set forth below. A decision, either a finding for or against the Owner, may be by a majority vote of the Board of Directors or hearing body, as allowed for under the Governing Documents. The Board may also issue and record a Notice of Finding of Violation with the Clerk and Recorder. Upon notice of satisfactory compliance with the Governing Documents, the Notice of Finding of Violation may be released by the Association issuing and recording a Release of Notice of Finding of Violation.

### b. Cure Process and Fine Procedure For Violations Of Governing Documents That Threaten Public Safety Or Health

#### i. 
With respect to any violation of the Governing Documents that the Association reasonably determines threatens the public safety or health, the Association shall provide the Owner a written Notice of Finding of Violation (which need not be via certified mail, return receipt requested), in English and in any language that the Owner has indicated a preference for correspondence and notices, informing the Owner that the Owner has seventy-two (72) hours to cure the violation or the Association may fine the Owner.

#### ii. 
If, after inspection of the Unit, the Association determines that the Owner has not cured the violation within seventy-two (72) hours after receiving the Notice of Finding of Violation, the Association may impose fines on the Owner.

#### iii. 
If, after inspection of the Unit, the Association determines that the Owner has not cured the violation within seventy-two (72) hours after receiving the Notice of Finding of Violation, the Association may take legal action against the Owner for the violation, except that the Association shall not pursue foreclosure against the Owner based on fines owed.

### c. Cure Process and Fine Procedure For Violations Of Governing Documents That Do Not Threaten Public Safety Or Health

#### i. 
If an Association reasonably determines that an Owner committed a violation of the Governing Documents of the Association, other than a violation that threatens the public safety or health, the Association shall, through certified mail, return receipt requested, provide the Owner a Notice of Finding of Violation, in English and in any language that the Owner has indicated a preference for correspondence and notices, informing the Owner that the Owner has thirty (30) days to cure the violation or the Association, after conducting an inspection and determining that the Owner has not cured the violation, may fine the Owner; however, the total amount of fines imposed for the violation may not exceed five hundred dollars ($500.00).

#### ii. 
An Association shall grant an Owner two consecutive thirty (30) day periods to cure a violation before the Association may take legal action against the Owner for the violation. An Association shall not pursue foreclosure against the unit Owner based on fines owed.

#### iii. 
If the Owner cures the violation within the period to cure afforded the Owner, the Owner may notify the Association of the cure and, if the Owner sends with the notice visual evidence that the violation has been cured, the violation is deemed cured on the date that the Owner sends the notice. If the Owner's notice does not include visual evidence that the violation has been cured, the Association shall inspect the unit as soon as practicable to determine if the violation has been cured.

#### iv. 
If the Association does not receive notice from the Owner that the violation has been cured, the Association shall inspect the Unit within seven (7) days after the expiration of the thirty (30) day cure period to determine if the violation has been cured. If, after the inspection and whether or not the Association received notice from the Owner that the violation was cured, the Association determines that the violation has not been cured:

**A.** A second thirty (30) day period to cure commences if only one thirty (30) day period to cure has elapsed; or

**B.** The Association may take legal action if two thirty (30) day periods to cure have elapsed.

#### v. 
Once the Owner cures a violation, the Association shall notify the Owner, in English and in any language that the Owner has indicated a preference for correspondence and notices:

**A.** That the Owner will not be further fined with regard to the violation; and

**B.** Of any outstanding fine balance that the Owner still owes the Association.

### d. Fine Schedule

#### i. For Safety/Health Violations

**A.** For first violations that the Association reasonably determines threaten the public safety or health, the Association shall impose of fine of $500.00 (or another amount that the Board determines is necessary to secure compliance).

**B.** For second violations that the Association reasonably determines threaten the public safety or health, the Association shall impose of fine of $750.00 (or another amount that the Board determines is necessary to secure compliance).

**C.** For third and subsequent violations that the Association reasonably determines threaten the public safety or health, the Association shall impose of fine of $1,000.00 (or another amount that the Board determines is necessary to secure compliance).

**D.** The Association may assess, at an interval of every other day, a fine in the amount of $100.00/every other day (or another amount in this interval that the Board determines is necessary to secure compliance), for continuing and/or uncured violations that the Association reasonably determines threaten the public safety or health. There is no upper limit to the amount of fines that may be incurred for continuing and/or uncured violations that the Association reasonably determines threaten the public safety or health.

#### ii. For Non-Safety/Health Violations

**E.** The Association may assess, at an interval of once per week, a fine in the amount of $100.00 (or another amount in this interval that the Board determines is necessary to secure compliance), for continuing and/or uncured violations that the Association reasonably determines do not threaten the public safety or health. The total amount of fines incurred for continuing and/or uncured violations that the Association reasonably determines do not threaten the public safety or health may not exceed five hundred dollars ($500.00).

### e. Reserved Rights

#### i. 
The Board may establish the amount of the fine within or outside of the above ranges based upon the nature and severity of the violation, as determined in the sole and reasonable discretion of the Board, but subject, in the case of any non-health and safety violations, to the limit of $500.00. The Board may waive all, or any portion, of the fines if, in its sole and reasonable discretion, such waiver is appropriate under the circumstances. Additionally, the Board may condition waiver of the entire fine, or any portion thereof, upon the violator coming into compliance with the Governing Document(s) that he/she has violated.

#### ii. Payment of Fines
All fines shall be due and payable upon notice of the fine and will be considered late if not paid within fifteen (15) days of the date that the Owner is notified of the imposition of the fine. An interest charge of 8% per annum may be invoked 30 days after notice of the fine is given, plus a late charge, as provided for in the Association's Collection Policy. All fines and late charges may be considered collected as set forth in the Governing Documents and Colorado law. Fines may be in addition to all other remedies available to the Association pursuant to the terms of the Governing Documents and Colorado law, including the Association's right to collect attorneys' fees as authorized by Colorado law.

### f. Costs and Attorney Fees
If, after the enforcement process referred to above, the Board or other impartial decision maker determines that the Owner has committed the alleged violation, the Owner shall be responsible for paying the costs, attorneys' fees, and expenses incurred by the Association in engaging in the enforcement process. Such costs, attorney fees, and expenses shall be considered an assessment in the same manner as a fine and as an assessment is treated in the Governing Documents and Colorado law. If, after the enforcement process referred to above, the Board or other impartial decision maker determines that the Owner is not responsible for the alleged violation, the Association shall not allocate to the Owner's account with the Association any of the Association's costs or attorney fees incurred in asserting or hearing the claim.

### g. Additional Enforcement Rights

#### i. Default Assessment
In addition to fines, the Board may levy a Default Assessment against any Owner and Owner's Unit for those purposes set forth in the Declaration, including but not limited to, reimbursing the Association for costs incurred in bringing an Owner into compliance with the Governing Documents.

#### ii. Self-help Remedies
The Association or its duly authorized agents may have the power to enter any Unit or Common Elements to abate or remove, using such force as may be reasonably necessary, any structure, thing, or conditions that violate the Governing Documents. If the Association exercises its right subject to this paragraph, all costs of self-help may be assessed against the Owner's Unit and may be a lien on the Owner's Unit.

### h. Alternative Dispute Resolution

#### i. Discretionary Dispute Resolution Procedures – Between Owners
The Association strongly encourages Owners or residents with disputes against other Owners or residents to resolve such disputes without court proceedings and by using alternative methods of dispute resolution such as negotiation or mediation. The Association will take reasonable steps to facilitate negotiation or mediation between Owners and/or residents, but will have no responsibility for any costs incurred by the parties to the dispute resolution process or for the outcomes thereof. For any step in the dispute resolution process, the parties are not waiving their right to employ legal counsel at their own expense to assist them.

##### 1. Negotiation
A request for dispute resolution by negotiation may be initiated by any Owner. Any such request shall be in writing stating the material facts of the dispute and shall be personally delivered or sent by certified mail (return receipt requested) to the other party. So long as the other party agrees to negotiate, a meeting shall be held between the parties to begin a good faith attempt to negotiate a resolution not less than fifteen (15) or more than thirty (30) days of receipt of such request, unless otherwise extended by written agreement. Through negotiation, the parties will communicate directly with each other in an effort to reach an agreement that serves the interests of both parties. Should the dispute pertain to property issues, each party will be granted the right to inspect the alleged defects or problems at a time convenient to everyone involved.

##### 2. Mediation
If the dispute is not resolved by negotiation, any party may request in writing that the issue be submitted to mediation. The party shall send such request to the other party via personal delivery or certified mail (return receipt requested). If the parties agree to mediate the dispute prior to seeking other remedies, they shall participate in good faith in the mediation. The role of the mediator is to facilitate further negotiation between the parties. The mediator will not have power to decide how to resolve the dispute but will use recognized, accepted mediation techniques to assist the parties in making that decision. The mediator shall be selected by a consensus of the parties involved within fifteen (15) days of the receipt of the request. Any costs of mediation shall be shared equally among the parties unless they and the mediator agree otherwise.

#### ii. Required Dispute Resolution Procedure – Between Owner(s) and Association

##### 1. 
Prior to filing a lawsuit against the Association, the Board, or any officer, director, or Manager of the Association, an Owner must:

**a.** Send a written demand to the Board and the Association explaining the material facts of the matter desired to be included in their lawsuit; OR

**b.** The Owner may request and attend a hearing with the Board. Any such request for a hearing shall be in writing and shall be personally delivered or mailed certified mail (return receipt requested) to any member of the Board and the Association's Manager.

##### 2. 
The Owner, in such written demand or request for a hearing, shall make a good faith effort to explain the grievance to the Board and must allow the Association, the Board, the officer, director, and/or Manager (as applicable) the opportunity to resolve the dispute in an amicable fashion in not less than thirty (30) days.

##### 3. 
Upon receiving a request for a hearing, the Board shall give notice of the date, time, and place of the hearing to the person requesting the hearing. The Board shall schedule this hearing for a date not less than ten (10) or more than sixty (60) days from the date of receipt of the request. If the dispute cannot be resolved via the hearing, the parties shall utilize the mediation procedure set forth below.

##### 4. 
If the dispute between an Owner/resident and the Association is not resolved by the hearing, informal negotiation, or other required dispute resolution or Rule enforcement procedures, the Owner/resident and the Association must attempt to resolve their dispute in good faith via mediation before proceeding to litigation. The party with the grievance (the potential plaintiff in a lawsuit) shall send a mediation demand to the other party or parties via personal delivery, certified mail (return receipt requested), or other means of written or electronic communication that allows the date of receipt to be conclusively established. The parties shall have fifteen (15) days from the date of receipt of the mediation demand to jointly select a mediator. In the event that the recipient of the mediation demand either refuses to cooperate in selecting a mediator or refuses to participate in mediation, the party making the mediation demand may proceed forward with any contemplated litigation no earlier than thirty (30) days following the date that the mediation demand letter was received by the recipient. If the mediation is held and is unsuccessful, the parties are at liberty to proceed forward with litigation.

##### 5. 

## 6. INVESTMENT OF RESERVES AND RESERVE STUDY POLICY

### a. Investment Of Reserves Are Subject To The Standard Of Care
With regard to investment of reserve funds, directors and officers shall be subject to the standard of care set forth below. Officers, for purposes of this policy only, means any person designated as an officer of the Association and any person to whom the Board delegates responsibilities, including, without limitation, a managing agent, attorney, or accountant employed by the Board.

### b. The Standard Or Duty Of Care
Each director and officer shall perform their duties regarding investment of reserves in good faith, in a manner the director or officer reasonably believes to be in the best interests of the Association, and with the care an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would exercise under similar circumstances. In the performance of their duties, a director or officer shall be entitled to rely on information, opinions, reports, or statements, including financial statements and other financial data, in each case prepared or presented by: 

(a) one or more officers or employees of the Association whom the director or officer reasonably believes to be reliable and competent in the matters presented; 

(b) legal counsel, professional property manager, public accountant, or other persons as to matters which the director or officer reasonably believes to be within such person's professional or expert competence; or 

(c) a committee of the Association on which the director or officer does not serve if the director or officer reasonably believes the committee merits confidence.

#### i. Good Faith Requirements
