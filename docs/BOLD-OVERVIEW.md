Bold Solutions (boldsolutions.net) – Company Overview
Company Background and History

Bold Solutions (officially Bold Property Management Solutions) is a Colorado-based property management firm with roots dating back to 1983. The company began as Bold Real Estate Solutions LLC, founded by Onie Bolduc, and has remained locally owned and operated in the Vail Valley region ever since. Over the decades, Bold Solutions expanded its operations through strategic mergers and acquisitions. Notably, it merged with Sanctuary Property Management in 2012 and with Crossroads Realty in 2013. More recently, in 2021 Bold Solutions acquired Vail Home Rentals, one of the Vail Valley’s oldest property management companies, further broadening its rental management portfolio. These integrations have contributed to the company’s growth – as of the mid-2020s, Bold Solutions manages roughly 50 community associations (HOAs) comprising over 3,000 homeowners, and overall serves more than 4,000 homeowners and property investors from East Vail to Gypsum (and beyond) in Colorado’s mountain resort communities. Throughout its history, Bold Solutions has emphasized ethical practices and a community-focused approach, positioning itself as a trusted local leader in property management.

Mission and Vision

Bold Solutions’ mission centers on providing personalized, high-quality property management services with the attention to detail of a boutique firm, while leveraging the resources and technology of a larger company. The company explicitly values trust, ethics, loyalty, and integrity, pledging to deliver the “quality service you deserve” by building long-term partnerships with clients. This vision is reflected in their client relationships – Bold Solutions treats each client as a partner in managing their property assets. They pride themselves on being responsive and transparent, aiming to gain clients’ trust through consistent, ethical service. In practice, this means the firm strives to communicate openly, act with honesty, and respond quickly to property owners’ needs. Bold Solutions also highlights community care as part of its vision: it serves mountain resort communities “with integrity, responsiveness, and care,” a philosophy that has earned it a respected reputation in the Vail Valley. Overall, the company’s mission and vision focus on combining personal one-on-one attention with professional excellence, fostering peace of mind for homeowners and investors who entrust their properties to Bold Solutions.

Products and Services Offered

Bold Solutions is a full-service property management provider specializing in residential and community association management. Key services offered include:

Community Association Management (HOA Management): Managing the operations of homeowners associations and condominium communities. Bold’s team currently oversees approximately 50 Common Interest Communities (HOAs) with over 3,000 total homeowners. Services for HOAs include financial management (budgeting, accounting, dues collection), administrative management, enforcement of community rules, property maintenance oversight, and on-site staffing as needed. The company leverages advanced software to give HOA board members and owners on-demand access to their association’s financials, meeting minutes, and community news – enabling a transparent association management process.

Private Home Care Management: Comprehensive caretaking services for individual homeowners (including second homes and investment properties). Bold Solutions manages 75+ private homes, providing weekly property inspections, arranging and supervising all vendor services, and acting as the first point of contact for any emergency or non-emergency issues. This service is tailored for clients both local and abroad, meaning Bold handles on-the-ground responsibilities for homeowners who may not be present full-time. They coordinate housekeeping, security/alarm monitoring, spa and hot tub maintenance, trash removal, landscaping, snow removal, and more – essentially ensuring the home is well-maintained and ready for the owner’s use at any time.

Maintenance Services: An in-house maintenance division that attends to property upkeep and repairs. Bold Solutions maintains a fleet of vehicles and equipment operated by trained staff to perform a wide range of maintenance tasks on managed properties. Services include seasonal work like snow plowing and sidewalk clearing, landscaping and lawn care, routine cleaning (e.g. dryer vent cleaning), appliance servicing, small repairs, and general property upkeep. By self-performing many maintenance services, Bold can respond quickly and uphold quality standards across the properties it manages. The company emphasizes having the “newest fleet” of tools and vehicles, highlighting a commitment to efficiency and reliability in property maintenance.

Rental Management: Professional management for long-term rental properties. Bold Solutions is described as a leader in the long-term rental market in its region. For property owners who rent out homes or condos, Bold handles tenant placement (marketing vacancies and screening tenants), rent collection and accounting, coordination of any maintenance or repairs during tenancy, and overall tenant relations. Essentially, Bold acts as the landlord’s representative, managing day-to-day responsibilities and ensuring the rental investment is well cared for. This service allows owners to earn rental income without the hassle of direct oversight. (It’s worth noting that Bold’s acquisition of Vail Home Rentals in 2021 strengthened this service area by adding a well-established rental portfolio to its management.)

HOA Document Services (Resale & Disclosure Documents): As a complement to its HOA management, Bold Solutions facilitates the provision of official community documents needed in real estate transactions. Through a partnership with CondoCerts, an online document ordering platform, Bold provides timely access to resale disclosures, HOA governing documents, budgets, and mortgage questionnaires for title companies, real estate agents, and homeowners involved in selling or refinancing properties. This service streamlines the often complex process of obtaining required HOA documents by allowing parties to order them online and receive accurate, up-to-date information. By using CondoCerts – described as “the most advanced resale ordering system in the industry” – Bold ensures that all legal disclosure requirements for HOA properties are met efficiently.

In summary, Bold Solutions offers end-to-end property management services covering community (HOA) management, individual home caretaking, maintenance, and rental management, supported by modern document delivery systems. This integrated suite of services is aimed at providing worry-free ownership for clients – whether they are part of an HOA board, absentee homeowners, or rental investors – by handling all aspects of property and association management under one roof.

Technology and Platforms Used

Technology is a core part of Bold Solutions’ service delivery, as the company strives to be “technologically forward” in the property management industry. Bold Solutions utilizes modern software platforms to enhance transparency, efficiency, and client convenience:

Property Management Software / Owner Portal: Bold uses the AppFolio Property Manager software platform to manage its properties and associations, which includes a secure online portal for homeowners and board members. Through this platform, clients can log in to view account information (such as HOA financial statements, dues balances, meeting minutes, and community updates) at any time. Homeowners can also perform tasks like paying dues online and setting up automatic payments via the portal. The use of AppFolio and similar technologies allows Bold Solutions to offer a level of transparency and real-time access that sets it apart – as noted, homeowners can retrieve important information 24/7, resulting in a more transparent and informed community management process. This tech-driven approach is relatively unique in the local market, and Bold highlights that it is using property management software “unlike anyone else,” underscoring its commitment to innovation.

CondoCerts (HOA Document Platform): As mentioned above, Bold Solutions leverages the CondoCerts platform to handle HOA document requests. This is a cloud-based system where resale certificates, disclosure documents, and questionnaires can be ordered and delivered digitally. By adopting CondoCerts, Bold provides faster turnaround and accurate documentation for real estate transactions involving its managed communities, which is an important technology integration for a property management firm. It relieves the HOA managers from manual paperwork and ensures compliance with state disclosure laws by automating the process.

Communication and Social Platforms: Bold Solutions maintains a presence on social media (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn), which it uses to communicate updates and engage with the community. While not a “platform” in the operational sense, this online engagement reflects Bold’s willingness to connect with clients through multiple channels. Internally, the team likely uses industry-standard communication tools and mobile technology to stay responsive (for example, field staff using mobile apps to track maintenance requests), though specific internal tools are not publicly detailed. The company’s website also features a Contact Us form and digital request forms for maintenance/design review submissions, indicating that clients can interact with Bold’s services online for convenience.

Overall, Bold Solutions’ use of technology – from the AppFolio management portal to specialized services like CondoCerts – illustrates its focus on modernizing property management. By embracing these platforms, Bold is able to offer e-services such as online payments, digital document access, and swift communication, aligning with the expectations of homeowners and investors in a digital age. This tech-enabled approach supports Bold’s mission of transparency and high-quality service by giving clients convenient tools and real-time information about their properties.

Key Leadership and Team

Bold Solutions is led by a team of experienced professionals in property management and real estate. The key leadership includes:

Christopher Tanis – President: Christopher (Chris) Tanis serves as the President of Bold Solutions. With over 30 years of experience in real estate development and investments in Colorado, Tanis has been a driving force in the company’s growth. He joined Bold around 2010–2011 and became a partner in the business. Under his leadership, Bold Solutions executed major expansions (such as the mergers in 2012–2013 and the 2021 acquisition). Tanis’s background is notable – he transitioned from a career in the private aviation industry to real estate, bringing a diverse professional skill set. He holds a B.S. in International Business from Lehigh University. As President, Chris Tanis focuses on strategic direction, client relationships, and ensuring the company’s values of integrity and quality service are upheld. (In some references he is also described as a Partner/Owner of the company, underscoring his stake in the business.)

Adam Savin – Partner / Co-Owner: Adam Savin is the principal business partner alongside Tanis. He is often identified as a Partner or President/Owner of Bold Solutions. Adam Savin co-leads the firm’s operations and strategy, and has been instrumental in managing the company’s growth. The Better Business Bureau lists Mr. Savin as President/Owner, indicating he likely handles a significant portion of the executive management and perhaps the ownership responsibilities. Together, Savin and Tanis have shaped Bold Solutions into a comprehensive property management provider in the Vail Valley. (Note: Chris Tanis and Adam Savin are frequently mentioned jointly as the leadership team driving Bold’s success.)

Mike Ball – Chief Financial Officer (CFO): Mike Ball oversees Bold Solutions’ financial operations as CFO. In this role, he manages budgeting, financial reporting for HOAs, and the fiscal health of the company. Given property management involves handling client funds (HOA dues, rental incomes, etc.), the CFO’s role is critical for transparency and trust. Mike Ball’s presence on the team highlights Bold’s commitment to sound financial management and accountability.

Cealy Fellman – Controller: Cealy Fellman is the Controller at Bold Solutions, responsible for accounting and financial controls. She likely manages bookkeeping, accounts payable/receivable, and ensures that each association’s and client’s financial accounts are accurate. Having both a Controller and a CFO indicates a robust internal finance team, which is important for a firm managing numerous separate HOA budgets and property accounts.

Munsey Knox – Director of Associations: Munsey Knox leads the community association management division. As Director of Associations, Knox oversees the portfolio of HOA communities, coordinating the association managers and ensuring that each HOA’s needs are met. This includes board communications, annual meetings, maintenance projects for communities, and compliance with association bylaws. Munsey Knox’s role is central to maintaining service quality across all homeowner associations under Bold’s care. (Munsey is even quoted in external contexts as a representative of Bold, indicating his active role with clients.)

Tom Barela – Director of Maintenance: Tom Barela heads the maintenance department. He manages the maintenance staff and operations, including scheduling of regular property maintenance, snow removal crews, landscaping teams, and addressing work orders from residents. Under his direction, Bold’s maintenance services are executed efficiently with the company’s own equipment and personnel. Barela’s role ensures that physical aspects of the properties are well cared for, contributing to homeowner satisfaction and property value retention.

Additional Team Members: Bold Solutions’ team includes several Association Managers and support staff who handle day-to-day client services. For example, Amy VanGoey is a Senior Association Manager managing specific HOA accounts, and Monica Hedrick and Bryan Austin serve as Association Managers for various communities. Ted Phillips is listed as a Compliance Officer, likely focusing on enforcing community rules and architectural guidelines in HOAs. The team also has dedicated Accounting staff, such as Carly Tanis and Steve Litt, who work under the Controller to manage financial records. Dalia Salazar is noted as a Maintenance Coordinator, assisting the Director of Maintenance in dispatching and tracking maintenance jobs. Lastly, Annalisa Savin is listed in an administrative role, supporting office operations. This roster of professionals – spanning executive leadership, financial management, operations directors, property managers, and support roles – indicates that Bold Solutions has a relatively small but comprehensive team (on the order of ~15–20 staff) with expertise in each facet of property management. Each team member’s specialized role helps the company deliver personalized and expert service to clients.

In summary, Bold Solutions’ leadership is anchored by President Chris Tanis and Partner Adam Savin, with departmental heads like Mike Ball (CFO), Cealy Fellman (Controller), Munsey Knox (HOA Director), and Tom Barela (Maintenance Director) ensuring strong oversight in their respective areas. The broader team of association managers, coordinators, and accountants supports the day-to-day operations. This experienced team structure allows Bold Solutions to maintain high service standards and close client relationships, which are frequently cited as a hallmark of the company.

Clients and Industries Served

Bold Solutions primarily serves clients in the residential property management sector, focusing on homeowner associations and private homeowners in Colorado’s mountain resort communities. The company’s client base and service scope include:

Community Associations (HOAs and Condominium Communities): A major portion of Bold’s clientele are HOA boards and the collective homeowners within those communities. These can range from condominium complexes and townhome communities to neighborhoods with shared amenities, largely in resort areas. By providing association management, Bold serves the interests of all homeowners in those communities (over 3,000 individual homeowners across ~50 associations). The industries served here intersect with real estate and housing, specifically resort residential communities. For instance, Bold Solutions manages associations in high-end developments such as Cordillera, Arrowhead, and other neighborhoods in the Vail Valley (as evidenced by client testimonials from those communities). These clients rely on Bold to handle the administrative and maintenance workload of their communities.

Individual Homeowners and Investors: Bold Solutions also caters to private property owners, including owners of vacation homes, second homes, or investment properties. Many of these clients are absentee owners (living outside the Vail area or even abroad) who need a reliable local firm to care for their property. Bold’s private home care services are tailored to this demographic, which includes affluent individuals who own mountain homes as well as real estate investors renting out properties long-term. The company explicitly mentions serving “resort residents, homeowners and investors”, reflecting a broad range from local homeowners to international investors with property interests in Colorado. These clients span the residential real estate industry (some are in the rental market, others simply asset holders).

Geographical Focus – Vail Valley Resorts: Bold Solutions’ services are concentrated in Eagle County, Colorado, particularly the Vail Valley region. This includes the towns and resort communities from East Vail to Gypsum, encompassing Vail, Lionshead, Minturn, Avon, Beaver Creek, Edwards, Eagle, Gypsum, and surrounding areas. Within this region are world-class ski resort communities and golf communities (like Beaver Creek, Arrowhead, Cordillera, etc.), which form Bold’s core market. The company has grown to serve over 4,000 homeowners in these areas and around the world (meaning many of those homeowners hail from around the world, even if their properties are in Colorado). By focusing on a distinct geographic niche – luxury and resort residential communities – Bold Solutions has developed specialized knowledge of local regulations, climate-related maintenance needs (snow, etc.), and the service expectations of clients in a vacation-oriented environment.

Property Types: The types of properties managed by Bold are primarily residential. This includes single-family homes, luxury estates, condos, townhouses, and occasionally mixed-use buildings if part of an HOA. While Bold’s marketing emphasizes residential sectors (and there’s no indication they manage commercial-only properties), some of the HOAs could include mixed residential/commercial elements (for example, a condo building with ground-floor retail). However, the company does not advertise any separate commercial property management service, so its industry focus remains on housing/community management. In summary, the industries served are residential real estate and property management, particularly within the context of vacation home management and community association management in a resort setting.

Client Profile and Needs: Clients of Bold Solutions typically seek convenience and peace of mind. HOA boards want a professional firm that can navigate Colorado’s legal requirements for associations, maintain property values, and handle homeowner concerns. Individual owners (especially non-local ones) need a trustworthy manager for their valuable homes. Investors want maximum return with minimal vacancy and maintenance issues. Bold’s services are oriented to meet these needs, which is why the company highlights both its personalized approach and its comprehensive resources. For example, international or out-of-state homeowners appreciate that Bold can represent them in emergencies and keep their mountain retreat in top condition year-round. Meanwhile, local HOAs appreciate having a forward-thinking manager that offers online tools and transparent accounting.

In essence, Bold Solutions serves the residential property management industry in resort areas, with clients ranging from large HOA communities to individual luxury homeowners. By focusing on the Vail Valley niche, the company has built a strong reputation among Colorado resort homeowners and community associations, becoming a go-to provider in that segment. Its client-centric, partnership approach (calling clients “partners”) further indicates that Bold views its service as collaborative across the real estate and hospitality domain – supporting the broader industry of maintaining vacation properties and high-value homes.

Notable Partnerships and Collaborations

Bold Solutions has engaged in several notable partnerships, collaborations, and strategic moves that have shaped its business:

Mergers with Local Firms: Bold’s growth has been fueled by partnering with and merging complementary local businesses. In 2012, President Chris Tanis merged his prior company Sanctuary Property Management into Bold Property Management Solutions. This collaboration brought additional properties and expertise under the Bold umbrella. The following year, in 2013, Bold merged with Crossroads Realty, a local real estate firm, further expanding its client base and service offerings. These mergers were effectively partnerships that unified operations, staff, and client portfolios, allowing Bold Solutions to offer a wider array of services (for instance, Crossroads Realty likely contributed real estate sales or rental brokerage experience). Such collaborations indicate Bold’s strategy of joining forces with established local entities to strengthen its market position in the Vail Valley.

Acquisition of Vail Home Rentals: In 2021, Bold Solutions acquired Vail Home Rentals, which was one of the oldest and most well-known property management companies in the Vail Valley. Rather than a merger, this was an acquisition, but it involved integrating the team and clients of Vail Home Rentals into Bold’s operations – essentially a collaborative transition. Through this deal, Bold gained a significant foothold in the long-term rental and vacation home segment, inheriting Vail Home Rentals’ decades of experience and client relationships. The acquisition is notable because it shows Bold Solutions collaborating with a legacy company to preserve service continuity for clients. It was likely celebrated in the local business news as it combined two respected local brands, and it demonstrated Bold’s commitment to long-term growth through partnership-like integrations.

Community and Vendor Partnerships: On an ongoing basis, Bold Solutions partners closely with local service providers and contractors to fulfill its maintenance and home care duties. For example, the company works with landscaping firms, snow removal services, cleaning companies, and repair technicians in the Vail area. While these partnerships are not always publicized, they are crucial collaborations that enable Bold to deliver comprehensive services. (One such example is a local cleaning service’s site quoting Munsey Knox of Bold Solutions as a satisfied client, indicating Bold partners with specialized vendors for club and facility cleaning.) Additionally, Bold Solutions likely maintains good relationships with local real estate agencies and brokers, given its involvement in HOA document provision and rental management. The company’s integration with Crossroads Realty in 2013 exemplifies the synergy between property management and real estate sales, suggesting ongoing collaboration with the real estate community.

Technology Partnerships: Bold’s use of the AppFolio platform and CondoCerts system can be seen as partnerships with technology providers. By aligning with these industry-leading platforms, Bold collaborates to improve its service delivery. For instance, AppFolio might offer Bold specialized support or features, effectively partnering to ensure Bold’s clients have a smooth digital experience. These are vendor partnerships, but notable because they influence how Bold Solutions operates in a modern context.

Client as Partners Philosophy: It’s worth noting that Bold Solutions internally treats its clients as “partners” – a philosophy explicitly stated on their site. While not a traditional partnership, this mindset means the company often works hand-in-hand with HOA boards (somewhat like a collaboration) to make decisions that benefit communities. For example, Bold might partner with an HOA board on long-term improvement plans or budgeting strategies, functioning more as a collaborative consultant than just an outside contractor. This approach likely leads to strong partnerships at the community level, where trust and mutual goals are established.

Overall, Bold Solutions’ notable collaborations have largely been through mergers and acquisitions of local companies, which have allowed it to grow substantially and incorporate the strengths of those firms. These strategic partnerships – Sanctuary Property Management, Crossroads Realty, and Vail Home Rentals – stand out as key milestones. In addition, Bold’s day-to-day collaborations with vendors and its close work with community stakeholders underscore a cooperative business model. By building partnerships both within the industry and with the communities it serves, Bold Solutions has cemented its role as a deeply integrated player in the local property management landscape.

Case Studies and Success Stories

Bold Solutions’ track record includes various success stories and examples of positive outcomes for its clients and the company itself. While formal “case studies” are not published on its site, the following highlights serve as illustrative success stories:

Award-Winning Property Management: A testament to Bold Solutions’ success is its recognition in local awards. The company has been voted the “Best Property Management Company” in the Vail Daily’s annual Best of Vail Valley awards multiple times. For example, Bold won this honor for the 2022–2023 cycle, and again for 2025–2026 (as the Vail Daily readers’ choice winner). Being a repeat winner in a community-driven award indicates a high level of customer satisfaction and reputation. Bold Solutions itself proudly announced these accolades, thanking clients and community partners for helping them achieve “the best in the Valley”. Such awards function as success stories, demonstrating that Bold’s approach to service has resonated strongly with the local community and that it outperforms competitors in the eyes of the public.

Client Testimonials (Quality Service and Responsiveness): The praise from Bold Solutions’ clients provides real-world success examples. Numerous homeowners and board members have shared positive feedback about their experiences. For instance, a property owner in the Cordillera community stated that “without exaggeration, [Bold] has been the most responsible and effective property manager we have had.” This highlights success in improving the management of a community that likely had prior managers. Another homeowner from the Minturn area praised Bold’s team for exceptionally responsive communication, noting that questions were answered completely “almost before I hit send on my emails”. Additionally, an owner from Arrowhead (a prestigious resort community) thanked Bold Solutions for the “fine work” in maintaining the property during their stay – “the hot tub was perfectly hot each time… walks were nicely cleared; the roads were plowed. Everything seemed in perfect working order.”. These anecdotes serve as mini case studies showing Bold’s effectiveness: in Cordillera, they improved management accountability; in Minturn, they excelled in communication; in Arrowhead, they delivered top-notch maintenance and upkeep. The consistency of such testimonials across different communities indicates success in meeting diverse client needs (from financial management to physical maintenance).

Growth and Integration Success: Bold Solutions’ ability to grow without sacrificing service quality is another success story. The integration of acquired companies stands out. For example, after acquiring Vail Home Rentals in 2021, Bold successfully absorbed its operations and clients, expanding its service to over 4,000 homeowners worldwide. A potential measure of this success is that Bold retained Vail Home Rentals’ client base and likely improved their service by providing access to Bold’s technological platforms and broader resources. Similarly, the earlier mergers (Sanctuary and Crossroads) can be seen as case studies in expansion: Bold managed to merge company cultures and systems and emerge stronger. The Vail Daily Bizwatch profile from 2021 effectively narrates this story – Bold grew from a smaller outfit into a leading local firm through these strategic moves. The success is evident in the numbers (more communities and homes under management) and the sustained high regard in the community (as reflected by awards and client feedback post-expansion). Not all companies navigate growth smoothly, but Bold’s leadership by Tanis and Savin ensured that new clients were integrated and the company’s core values were maintained.

Community Impact: Another success aspect is Bold Solutions’ impact on the communities it manages. For example, by enforcing rules fairly and maintaining properties diligently, Bold has improved property values and resident satisfaction in those neighborhoods. A hypothetical case study could be an HOA that was struggling with compliance or maintenance before hiring Bold, and after a year under Bold’s management, the community saw improvements (e.g., projects completed on time, budget surpluses achieved, happier residents). While specific HOA names aren’t given in marketing materials, Bold’s renewal and retention rate of communities can be inferred as high given its longevity and growth via word-of-mouth. The Vail Daily article notes that under Tanis’s leadership, Bold came to serve communities “from East Vail to Gypsum,” implying they successfully took on many communities in the region. Each of those could be seen as a success story of onboarding a new community and delivering results that likely led to continued contracts.

Reputation for Integrity and Trust: Ultimately, Bold Solutions’ biggest success is building a trusted brand in a small, tight-knit market. Being invited to manage some of the Vail Valley’s most exclusive communities (like those in Beaver Creek, Arrowhead, and Cordillera) suggests that Bold earned trust through prior successes. The company’s emphasis on ethics and loyalty has translated into a reputation where clients publicly acknowledge their trust in Bold. For instance, the statement from a Minturn property owner “there is no question that you all have your act together” signals that Bold has set itself apart through professionalism. In an industry where property owners entrust one of their most valuable assets to a manager, this trust is a key success metric. The Best of Vail Valley awards, client testimonials, and growth milestones all converge to show that Bold Solutions has a strong success narrative – of a company that started local, expanded smartly, and consistently delivered on promises, thereby achieving both client loyalty and industry recognition.

News Mentions and Press Releases

Bold Solutions has been featured in local media and company communications, highlighting its developments and community involvement. Some notable news mentions include:

Vail Daily “Bizwatch” Feature (May 2021): The Vail Daily, a leading local newspaper in Eagle County, profiled Bold Property Management Solutions in its Bizwatch business column on May 8, 2021. This article introduced readers to Bold Solutions’ services and leadership. It discussed President Chris Tanis’s background and the company’s evolution, including the mergers with Sanctuary Property Management and Crossroads Realty, and the then-recent acquisition of Vail Home Rentals. In the Bizwatch piece, Tanis described the company’s growth and how Bold was now serving over 4,000 homeowners in the Vail Valley. The feature provided publicity and validated Bold’s status as a prominent local business. (The company proudly shared this news on social media at the time, indicating it was an honor to be featured in the paper.) This press mention is significant because it documents Bold Solutions’ journey and success for the wider community, essentially serving as a published case study of the business.

Press Releases / Announcements: While Bold Solutions is a private company and may not issue formal press releases regularly, it does make announcements through its website and social channels. For example, Bold used its website to announce the Best of Vail Valley award wins, with a “Bold Solutions Wins Again!” news update on being voted Best Property Management Company for 2025/2026. The website invited visitors to “Read More” about this achievement, suggesting a press-release-style blog post with details (such as thanking clients and staff). Similarly, the company likely shared news of the Vail Home Rentals acquisition in 2021 via a press release or blog post to inform clients of the expanded services (the Vail Daily coverage might have been partly based on such a release or interview). On social media, Bold Solutions posts updates about nominations, awards, new services, and team highlights, functioning as informal press announcements.

Community Newsletters and HOA Communications: Another way Bold Solutions shows up in “press” is through community communications. As the managing agent for many HOAs, Bold often writes newsletters or updates for those communities. Occasionally, local HOA newsletters or community websites (for example, Buckhorn Valley HOA or others) mention Bold Solutions and its personnel as points of contact. These aren’t press articles per se, but they do publicly acknowledge Bold’s role in the community. For instance, an HOA site might list “Bold Solutions (Chris Tanis, President) as the management company for our association”. This steady presence in community communications reinforces Bold’s local visibility.

Online Reviews and Listings: Bold Solutions is listed on platforms like Yelp, Facebook, and Better Business Bureau, which sometimes include narrative feedback or information that can serve as public “mentions.” For example, the Yelp listing (established 1983, etc.) and BBB profile provide factual details that have made their way into the public domain. While not traditional press, these sites are public records that potential clients read. Notably, the BBB profile lists key company data and leadership names, and Yelp hosts a few customer reviews (both positive testimonials and the occasional negative comment, as is common). Bold’s team likely monitors these and addresses issues as part of their public relations.

Social Media Highlights: Bold Solutions’ Facebook and Instagram pages act as quasi-press outlets for lighter news. They have shared achievements like being featured in Vail Daily or being nominated for awards, as well as posts like holiday greetings, company culture events, or job openings (e.g., hiring a Controller, etc., which was posted on Facebook). One notable post thanked the community for voting Bold as Best Property Management Company in 2022–23, linking to VailDaily.com’s announcement of winners. These posts serve to publicly document Bold’s milestones and engagement with the community.

It appears that most of Bold Solutions’ media coverage is local and positive, focusing on its business milestones and community recognition. There are no known major negative news stories or controversies reported in the press regarding Bold Solutions, which speaks to its stable reputation. The lack of national press is expected for a regional company of this nature. Instead, Bold’s public narrative is carried through local newspapers, industry profiles, and its own communications.

In summary, press and news mentions for Bold Solutions highlight its evolution (e.g., the 2021 Vail Daily profile detailing its expansions) and celebrate its accolades (e.g., multiple “Best of Vail Valley” wins). The company leverages its website and social media as the main channels for announcements, functioning as its own press outlet for sharing success stories and updates with clients and the community. Anyone researching Bold Solutions will find a trail of credible local news articles and official posts that collectively paint a picture of a thriving, community-oriented property management firm.

Contact Information and Office Locations

Bold Solutions maintains a primary office in the Vail Valley of Colorado, through which it serves all its clients. The main contact and location details are as follows:

Office Address: 101 Fawcett Road, Suite #220, Avon, CO 81620. (Note: Avon is a town in Eagle County, just at the base of Beaver Creek Resort and near Vail. This central location positions the office conveniently to serve properties in Vail, Beaver Creek, Edwards, and surrounding communities.) The company also lists PO Box 5800, Avon, CO 81620 for mailing purposes, which is common for businesses in mountain towns with limited street mail delivery.

Phone Number: (970) 949-6070. This is the main telephone line to reach Bold Solutions. Clients can call this number for inquiries, service requests, or emergency needs. The area code 970 indicates it’s a Colorado mountain region phone number. During business hours (typically 9am–5pm Mon-Fri, based on local business norms), this line would connect to Bold’s office staff. For after-hours emergencies, Bold likely has an on-call system accessible via this number as well.

Email and Contact Form: While a direct email address isn’t publicly listed in plain text on the website, Bold Solutions provides a Contact Us form on their official site. The form allows one to submit their Name, Email, Phone, and Message, which will deliver an inquiry to the Bold Solutions team. Additionally, the BBB directory indicates an email contact (through a “Email Business” link), and the KeyCrew profile suggests a general contact email format. However, the recommended method is to either call or use the website form, ensuring the inquiry goes to the appropriate department. It’s likely that Bold also corresponds via an office email (for example, a general inbox like info@boldsolutions.net or similar) for official communications, though that is handled internally.

Website: The official website is www.boldsolutions.net . The site provides detailed information on services, staff, and client portals. It also includes the resident logins (for AppFolio and document access) and the aforementioned contact form. The website is a primary resource for both prospective clients (to learn about the company) and current clients (to log in to their accounts or get updates). Bold Solutions likely updates its site with any important announcements or changes in contact details.

Social Media: Bold Solutions is present on social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and LinkedIn. The handles or page names are typically “Bold Property Management Solutions” or a variant thereof. These platforms can also be used to contact or follow the company for updates. For instance, the Facebook page might allow messaging, and the LinkedIn page provides company news and job postings. While not a physical contact point, these channels complement the official contact methods by providing additional ways to engage with the company.

Office Location/Service Area: Bold’s single office in Avon serves the entire Vail Valley region; thus, it does not have multiple branch offices (no indication of offices outside Eagle County). However, through that central office, Bold’s staff are mobile and often on-site at various properties daily. The Avon office is likely where the management and administrative team is based (President, accounting staff, etc.), and it might also double as a local hoa meeting space or client meeting spot when needed. Given the nature of resort communities, much of Bold’s work is done in the field (inspecting homes, meeting HOA boards at community clubhouses, etc.), but the Avon office is the official business location where records are kept and where one can visit or send correspondence.

For any inquiries or service requests, clients and prospects can call the provided phone number or use the website’s contact form, and the Bold Solutions team will respond promptly (the site assures “we’ll get back to you soon” after form submission). The contact information is also displayed on every page of Bold’s website footer for easy reference, underscoring the company’s openness to communication.
