## Market Gaps (Our Opportunity)

### Gap 1: AI-Powered Document Q&A
**No competitor offers this.** Homeowners can't ask "What are the rules about parking RVs?" and get a cited answer from their governing documents.

### Gap 2: Transparency-First Design
Most tools are designed for **management control**, not **homeowner access**. We flip this: homeowner access is primary.

### Gap 3: Modern UI/UX
Many competitors have dated interfaces. Modern, mobile-first design is a differentiator.

### Gap 4: Citation-Based Answers
When AI answers questions, we cite the source document. No competitor does this.

### Gap 5: Affordable AI
AI features in competitors (HOAi, Stan AI) are enterprise-priced and management-focused. We bring AI to homeowners at SMB prices.

---

## Competitive Positioning

### Our Unique Value

> **"The only HOA portal where homeowners can ask questions in plain English and get cited answers from their governing documents."**

### Positioning Statement

For **self-managed and small HOAs** who want **homeowners to understand their rules without endless questions to the Board**, our product is a **transparency portal with AI-powered document Q&A** that **answers questions with citations to source documents**.

Unlike **HOA Express** and **RunHOA** which only store documents, or **PayHOA** which focuses on payments, our product **makes documents actually useful** through AI.

---

## Competitive Threats

| Threat | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|--------|------------|------------|
| HOA Express adds AI | Medium | Move fast, build moat with citations |
| PayHOA adds AI | Medium | Focus on transparency, not payments |
| New AI-native entrant | Low-Medium | First-mover advantage, community |
| ChatGPT-based DIY | Low | Integration, UX, document ingestion |

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate (MVP)
1. **Launch with AI Q&A as hero feature** - This is our moat
2. **Price competitively** - $29-79/mo undercuts most
3. **Target self-managed HOAs** - Less competition, more pain

### Short-Term (3-6 months)
