## Business model and services

Colorado Booting operates on a **zero-cost model for property owners**, generating revenue exclusively from boot removal fees charged to vehicle owners who violate posted parking regulations. This B2B service model creates partnerships with apartment complexes, condominiums, retail centers, and HOAs who want parking enforcement without incurring direct costs.

The company's core service offerings include **vehicle immobilization** using wheel clamps (commonly called "Denver Boots"), towing services for situations where booting is impractical, parking consultation for property optimization, and an **online management portal** at parkingcode.com for real-time enforcement tracking and boot removal payments.

**Pricing structure** remains somewhat unclear from official sources. Colorado PUC regulations cap standard boot removal fees at **$160**, though customer complaints have documented charges of **$200** for dual-boot removal. The company's terms explicitly state all payments are **non-refundable**, and unpaid balances sent to collections incur a **50% additional collection fee**. Under 2025 legislation, companies must release boots once the vehicle owner pays at least 15% of fees, not to exceed **$60**.

## Geographic footprint spans Colorado's ski country

Colorado Booting has carved out a **distinct geographic niche** in western Colorado's mountain resort communities, operating exclusively along the I-70 corridor and in ski destination areas. The company notably **does not operate** in Denver, the Front Range, Colorado Springs, or Boulder—markets dominated by different competitors.

Primary service regions include the **Vail Valley** (Vail, Avon, Edwards, Eagle, Minturn, Gypsum), **Summit County** (Breckenridge, Silverthorne, Dillon, Keystone), and the **Roaring Fork Valley** (Aspen, Glenwood Springs, Carbondale, New Castle). This geographic specialization positions the company as the dominant—and possibly only—private booting operator serving these tourism-heavy mountain communities.

## Leadership remains largely unknown

Despite eight years of operation, Colorado Booting maintains an unusually low public profile regarding its leadership. Beyond **Ashlie Jarezenski** listed as registered agent at an address in San Luis, Colorado (approximately 200 miles south of the company's operational headquarters in Avon), no founders, executives, or management team members have been publicly identified.

The company has no LinkedIn company page, no executive profiles in business databases, and BBB listings note only an anonymous "Owner/Manager" contact type. This lack of transparency contrasts with competitors who publicly identify ownership and management personnel.

## Client portfolio spans apartments, retail, and resorts

Colorado Booting has assembled an impressive roster of approximately **90+ client properties** across diverse property types, leveraging its position as the primary booting provider in ski resort communities.

**Major retail clients** include nationally recognizable brands: **Home Depot** (Avon), **Walmart** (Avon), and **Safeway Vail**. The company also services shopping centers including Traer Creek Plaza, Westgate Plaza, and Design & Craft Center in Edwards.

**Residential properties** form the company's largest client category, encompassing numerous apartment complexes (6 West Apartments, Alta Verde, Altitude Apartments, Blue River Apartments, Machebeuf Apartments, and over a dozen others), condominiums (Beaver Bench, Brooktree, Cornerstone, SunRiver, and more), and HOAs/townhome associations throughout Eagle, Summit, and Garfield counties.

**Hospitality and resort clients** include Beaver Creek Resort, Aspen Country Inn, and ComfortInn Avon. The company also services mobile home parks, special districts like Eagle River Water & Sanitation District, and vacation rental properties.

## Colorado's evolving regulatory framework

Colorado maintains one of the **most comprehensive regulatory frameworks** for vehicle booting in the United States, with the **Colorado Public Utilities Commission (PUC)** serving as the primary oversight authority since 2019. Regulations are codified in **4 CCR 723-6** (Rules 6800-6899).

All booting companies must obtain a **PUC permit** ($150-153 application fee), undergo criminal history checks, maintain minimum insurance requirements, and disclose principal owners. The PUC can suspend, revoke, or refuse permits for felonies committed within five years or violations of immobilization regulations.

**Key regulatory requirements include:**
- Maximum standard boot removal fee: **$160**
- Release time: **90 minutes** during business hours, **120 minutes** after hours
- Signage: Minimum one square foot with 1-inch lettering at each parking lot entrance
- Prohibition on booting occupied vehicles
- Prohibition on booting vehicles solely for expired registration
- Required documentation with unique serial numbers and complaint contact information

**HB25-1117**, signed by Governor Jared Polis in 2025, significantly strengthened consumer protections by requiring **24-hour written notice** before immobilization (with exceptions), prohibiting **indiscriminate patrolling**, mandating a **$60 maximum payment option** for boot release, and requiring companies to obtain individual permission from property owners within 24 hours before each immobilization.

## Media coverage frames industry as predatory

Colorado Booting has been caught up in extensive media coverage examining the broader booting industry, which Colorado lawmakers have repeatedly characterized as "predatory."

**Denver7 Investigates** has been "exposing towing and booting practices for years," with 2025 coverage highlighting the industry's problematic incentive structure. Zach Neumann of the Community Economic Defense Project told Denver7: "What's interesting is a lot of the predatory behavior we saw in big towing is now also present in booting... They only make money when they put boots on cars. So what are they incentivized to do? Boot more cars."

**KRDO News** covered the signing of HB25-1117 with the headline "'Predatory industry': New Colorado law to crack down on car booting companies," featuring Rep. Mike Weissman's statement that "For most Coloradans, a car is not a convenience – it is a livelihood."

The **Denver Post** covered regulatory gaps in 2024 with "Legal loophole surrounding Colorado's booting industry to close." Industry publications like **Tow Industry Week** have covered the legislation from the industry perspective, warning the new law "could hinder enforcement."

The PUC has received **88 complaints about booting** companies over the three years preceding early 2025, prompting proposed rule changes to address regulatory gaps.

## Customer complaints reveal troubling patterns

Colorado Booting's public reputation is **overwhelmingly negative**, anchored by an **F rating from the Better Business Bureau**—the lowest possible score. The company has accumulated **13 complaints** and has **failed to respond to any of them**, a primary factor in the failing grade. The BBB file was opened October 2, 2020, and the company currently has one active alert on file.

Common complaint themes include vehicles being booted **despite having valid parking passes**, excessive charges **exceeding the regulated $160 maximum** (with $200 charges reported for dual boots), aggressive booting at apartment complexes where residents have legitimate parking rights, and complete unresponsiveness to consumer complaints.

Representative BBB complaints paint a consistent picture:
- One reviewer reported being booted at their own apartment complex where they had lived for three years, with both a registered vehicle and a physical parking pass visible on their rearview mirror
- Another customer described paying for legitimate lodging at Treehouse units but waking to find two boots on their car
- A visitor reported being booted within hours while attending a friend's birthday party

The company's terms of service compound consumer concerns: all payments are declared **non-refundable**, and disputes require **binding arbitration** through the American Arbitration Association, effectively limiting legal recourse.

## Financial details remain private

As a privately-held LLC, Colorado Booting discloses no revenue figures, growth metrics, or financial performance data. No venture funding, private equity investment, or acquisition activity has been identified.

**Observable business indicators** include eight years of continuous operation since 2017, Good Standing status with the Colorado Secretary of State, an extensive client portfolio of 90+ properties, and geographic expansion across multiple mountain counties. The company's no-cost model for property owners suggests revenue depends entirely on boot removal volume.

## Competitive landscape shows geographic segmentation

The Colorado vehicle booting market is **geographically segmented**, with Colorado Booting dominating mountain communities while separate competitors serve the Front Range metropolitan areas.

**Colorado Parking Services, LLC** (Broomfield/Boulder) is the longest-established competitor, founded in 2001 with 24 years of operation. The company serves residential and commercial properties in the Denver metro and Boulder areas but has minimal geographic overlap with Colorado Booting's mountain territory.

**Park It Right, LLC** (Denver/Arvada), founded in 2015 by Joel Perri (30+ years in towing), differentiates through proprietary **remote-release technology** that allows drivers to pay via phone and receive a code to unlock the boot themselves. The company has faced its own controversies and terminated BBB participation.

**Colorado Parking Pros** (Denver Metro) also utilizes self-release code technology and positions itself as knowledgeable about Colorado's evolving enforcement laws.

**Clancy Systems International** (Denver) manufactures and sells the original "Denver Boot" device but does not provide enforcement services. The company acquired the original Denver Boot patent rights in 1986.

## Key takeaways and assessment

Colorado Booting LLC occupies a unique market position as the **dominant vehicle booting provider** in Colorado's lucrative ski resort communities, serving major retail brands and hundreds of residential properties across the Vail, Breckenridge, and Aspen regions. However, this operational success comes alongside **significant reputational challenges**: an F BBB rating, documented patterns of customer complaints alleging improper booting and overcharging, and complete absence of transparency regarding company leadership and ownership.

The company operates within an increasingly **regulated environment**, with 2025's HB25-1117 imposing substantial new requirements designed to curb practices legislators explicitly labeled "predatory." Whether Colorado Booting adapts to these requirements—and addresses its documented customer service failures—will likely determine its viability as regulations take full effect. Consumers who believe they have been improperly booted should document all circumstances and file complaints with the Colorado Public Utilities Commission.
