# Google Whisk Animation Prompts

Prompts for generating an animated GIF hero image for the Westlake Village HOA website using [Google Whisk](https://whisk.google.com).

## Theme

A charming, animated scene capturing the essence of Westlake Village Condominiums in Avon, Colorado with Beaver Creek ski resort in the background. The style should evoke classic simulation games like SimCity and Ski Resort Tycoon - warm, inviting, and slightly whimsical.
